After the First World War, the nationalists developed their foreign policy in the direction of opposition to political and economic imperialism and Cooperation of all nations in the cause of world peace. As part of this Policy, at its Delhi session in 1919, the Congress demanded India’s representation at the Peace Conference through its elected representatives.

Indians also continued to voice their sympathy for the freedom fight of other countries. The Irish and Egyptian people and the Government of Turkey were extended active support. At its Calcutta session in 1920, the Congress asked the people not to join the army to fight in West Asia.

The final results of the elections were declared in February 1937. The Indian National Congress emerged in power in eight of the provinces - the three exceptions being Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh. The All-India Muslim League failed to form the government in any province.

d)  All.

Answer: d.

Explanation:

In the midst of worsening wartime international situation, the British Government in its continued effort to secure Indian cooperation sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India on 23
March 1942.

This is known as Cripps Mission. The main recommendations of Cripps were:

•   The promise of Dominion Status to India,
•   Protection of minorities
•   Setting up of a Constituent Assembly in which there would be representatives from the Princely States along with those of the British Provinces,
•   There would be provision for any Province of British India not prepared to accept this Constitution, either to retain its present constitutional position or frame a constitution of its own.

The major political parties of the country rejected the Cripps proposals. Gandhi called Cripp’s proposals as a “Post-dated Cheque”. They did not like the rights of the Princely States either to send their representatives to the Constituent Assembly or to stay out of the Indian Union. The Muslim League was also dissatisfied as its demand for Pakistan had not been conceded in the proposal.

d)  All.

Answer: a

Explanation:

Desertification, along with climate change and the loss of biodiversity, were identified as the greatest challenges to sustainable development during the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Established in 1994, UNCCD is the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management. The Convention addresses specifically the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, known as the drylands, where some of the most vulnerable ecosystems and peoples can be found. In the 10-Year Strategy of the UNCCD (2008-2018) that was adopted in 2007, Parties to
the Convention further specified their goals: "to forge a global partnership to reverse
and prevent desertification/land degradation and to mitigate the effects of drought in affected areas in order to support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability". It is the first and only internationally legally binding framework set up to address the problem of desertification.

The Convention’s 195 parties work together to improve the living conditions for people in drylands, to maintain and restore land and soil productivity, and to mitigate the effects of drought. The UNCCD is particularly committed to a bottom-up approach, encouraging the participation of local people in combating desertification and land degradation. The UNCCD secretariat facilitates cooperation between developed and developing countries, particularly around knowledge and technology transfer for sustainable land management.

4.  Only permanent observers have voting rights in the Council. Which of the above statements is/are true?
a)  Only 1.
b)  Only2, 3 & 4. c)  Only 1 & 4.
d)  Only 1, 2 & 3.

Answer: d.

Explanation:

The Arctic Council is a high-level intergovernmental forum that addresses issues faced by the Arctic governments and the indigenous people of the Arctic. It has eight member countries: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States.

Only states with territory in the Arctic can be members of the Council. All eight
countries are members making the Arctic Council a circumpolar forum. The Council also has permanent and ad hoc observer countries and "permanent participants".

Chairmanship of the Council rotates every two years. The current chair is Canada, which serves until the Ministerial meeting in May 2015. Observer status is open to non-Arctic states approved by the Council at the Ministerial Meetings that occur once every two years. Permanent observers have no voting rights in the Council. As of May 2013, twelve non-Arctic states have Permanent Observer status. Observer states receive invitations
for most Council meetings. Their participation in projects and task forces within the
Working Groups is not always possible, but this poses few problems as few Observer
States want to participate at such a detailed level.

Ad hoc observer states need to request permission for their presence at each individual meeting; such requests are routine and most of them are granted. There are six ad hoc members, not including the European Union. At the 2013 Ministerial Meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, the EU requested full observer status. It was not granted, mostly because the members do not agree on the EU ban on hunting seals. Approved
intergovernmental and interparliamentary organizations (both global and regional) and non-governmental organizations can also obtain Observer Status.

TEST    –    20    (25    QUESTIONS)                                                                                       INSIGHTS   TEST    SERIES    -­‐    2015                                                  WWW.INSIGHTSONINDIA.COM  
    

•   Empowering the beneficiary – RSBY provides the participating BPL household with freedom of choice between public and private hospitals and makes him a potential client worth attracting on account of the significant revenues that hospitals stand to earn through the scheme.
•   Business Model for all Stakeholders – The scheme has been designed as a business model for a social sector scheme with incentives built for each stakeholder.
•   Hospitals – A hospital has the incentive to provide treatment to large number of beneficiaries as it is paid per beneficiary treated.
•   Intermediaries – The inclusion of intermediaries such as NGOs and MFIs which have a greater stake in assisting BPL households.
•   Information Technology (IT) Intensive – For the first time IT applications are being used for social sector scheme on such a large scale. Every beneficiary family is issued a biometric enabled smart card containing their fingerprints and photographs. All the hospitals empanelled under RSBY are IT enabled and connected to the server at the district level. This will ensure a smooth data flow regarding service utilization periodically.
•   Safe and foolproof – The use of biometric enabled smart card and a key management system makes this scheme safe and foolproof. The key management system of RSBY ensures that the card reaches the correct beneficiary and there remains accountability in terms of issuance of the smart card and its usage. The biometric enabled smart card ensures that only the real beneficiary can use the smart card.
•   Portability – The key feature of RSBY is that a beneficiary who has been enrolled in a particular district will be able to use his/ her smart card in any RSBY empanelled hospital across India. This makes the scheme truly unique and beneficial to the poor families that migrate from one place to the other. Cards can also be split for migrant workers to carry a share of the coverage with them separately.
•   Cash less and Paperless transactions – A beneficiary of RSBY gets cashless benefit in any of the empanelled hospitals.
