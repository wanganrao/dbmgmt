Question  1
Solution: a)
Unlike parallels of latitude, all meridians are of equal length. Thus, it was difficult to number the meridians. Hence, all countries decided that the count should begin from the meridian which passed through Greenwich, where the British Royal Observatory is located. This meridian is called the Prime Meridian. Its value is 0° longitude and from it we count 180°
eastward as well as 180° westward. The Prime Meridian divides the earth into two equal halves,
the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the longitude of a place  is followed by the letter E for the east and W for the west. It is, however, interesting to note that
180° East and 180° West meridians are on the same line.



Question  2

Solution: a)

The government appointed an expert committee chaired by Prof. Ranjit Roy Chaudhury (is a leading clinical pharmacologist in the country, who heads the India-WHO Programme in Rational Use of Drugs in India ) to formulate policy and guidelines for approval of new drugs, clinical trials and banning of drugs.



The Supreme Court ordered the Centre to wait for its nod while the authorities re-examined the cases under the new regulatory regime for 157 clinical trials that were approved by the government.


Question 3
Answer: c)
The earliest surviving miniature paintings are on palm leaves from the 10th century and on paper from the 14th century. The images accompanied texts in religious manuscripts  and illustrations of mythological epics. With the advent of the Mughals in the mid 16th century, the subjects of miniature paintings included portraits, court scenes, flora and fauna. In the Rajput (in Rajasthan) and Pahari (in the Punjab hills) courts, the paintings continued to bring to life poetry,  age old legends, religious mythology and the moods of love and changing seasons. The emphasis lay on
the creation of a mood  and the communication of bhava (emotion)  through a rich and lyrical style. Artists worked together inkarkhanas (workshops) often working together on a single painting; some specialising in composition and drawing while others were master colourists. The most notable traditions of miniature painting in India are the Mughal, Rajasthani, Pahari and
Deccani courts.

Question  4
Solution: a)
On 21st June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer. As a result, these areas receive more heat. The areas near the poles receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting. The North Pole is inclined towards the sun
and the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months. Since a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere is getting light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator. The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on
21st June. At this time in the Southern Hemisphere all these conditions are reversed. It is winter season there. The nights are longer than the days. This position of the earth is called the Summer Solstice.


On 22nd December,  the Tropic of Capricorn receives direct rays of the sun as the South Pole tilts towards it. As the sun’s rays fall vertically at the Tropic of Capricorn (23½° S), a larger portion of the Southern Hemisphere gets light. Therefore, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere with longer days and shorter nights. The reverse happens in the Northern Hemisphere. This position of the earth is called the Winter Solstice. For this reason, Christmas is celebrated in Australia in the summer season.




Question  5

Solution: c)
The Bill seeks to amend the Representation of People Act, 1951 (RPA, 1951). The two key changes brought about by the Bill are:


Even if a person is prohibited from voting due to being in police custody or in jail, as long as his name is entered on the electoral roll he shall not cease to be an elector. This implies that he can file nomination for an election.

The definition of “disqualified” in the Act has been amended. Currently, the definition of disqualified means disqualified for either being chosen as or being  a Member of Parliament or a State Legislature. The amendment adds a ground  to the definition that the disqualification has to be due to conviction for certain specified offences and can be on no other ground. Conviction for one of these offences would result in the person’s name being removed from the electoral roll and he would cease to be an elector.


This amendment Bill seeks to address the situation arising out of the Supreme Court’s judgment.

On July 10, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that  a person, who is in jail or in police custody, cannot contest elections to legislative bodies. The RPA, 1951 states that any contestant to an
election to legislative bodies has to be an “elector”, i.e., his name should be on the electoral roll


INSIGHTS ON INDIA MOCK EXAM SOLUTIONS – EXAM-1 http://insightsonindia.com                 Page 2

and he is not subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in Section 16 of the Representation of People Act, 1950. Among other things, that section disqualifies anyone from being on the electoral roll if he is disqualified from voting under the provisions of any law relating to corrupt practices and other offences in relation to elections. Another provision in the RPA, 1951 says that anyone in prison or on the lawful custody of the police (other than preventive detention) is not entitled to vote.

The Supreme Court concluded  that a person in jail or police custody is not entitled to vote, and therefore, is not an elector, and thus, cannot contest elections.



Question 6


Solution: c)

This site is located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, which is one of the most important routes into Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where women and men learnt to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know about.




Question 7
Solution: d)
Women tend to have  a lower mortality rate at every age. In the womb, male fetuses have  a higher mortality rate (babies are conceived  in a ratio estimated  to be from 107 to 170 males to 100 females, but the ratio at birth in the United States is only 105 males to 100 females). Among the smallest premature babies (those under  2 pounds or 900 g) females again have  a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female.


Life expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation, along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.

Life expectancy is also used in describing the physical quality of life of an area.

Disparities in life expectancy  are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support.

Life expectancies are also used when determining the value of a life settlement, a life insurance policy sold for a cash asset.
The Glasgow effect refers to the unexplained poor health and low life expectancy of Glaswegians compared to the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe.

These animals quickly swallow the grass and store it in a separate  part of the stomach called rumen. Here the food gets partially digested and is called cud. But cud later the cud returns to the mouth in small lumps and the animal chews it. This process is called rumination and rumination these animals are called ruminants. Ruminants.


The grass is rich in cellulose, a type of carbohydrate. Many animals, including humans, cannot digest cellulose. Ruminants  have a large sac-like structure between the small intestine and large intestine. The cellulose of the food is digested here by the action of certain bacteria which are not present in humans.

Question 16


Solution: d)


1. During the day, the land gets heated faster than the water. The air over the land becomes hotter and rises up. The cooler air from the sea rushes in towards the land to take its place. The warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle. The air from the sea is called the sea breeze.
2. At night it is exactly the reverse. The water cools down more slowly than the land. So, the cool
air from the land moves towards the sea. This is called the land breeze. NCERT science class VII chapter 4
Question 17

Solution: a)


There are three types of mountains- Fold Mountains, Block Mountains and the Volcanic Mountains. The Himalayan Mountains and the Alps are young fold mountains with rugged relief and high conical peaks. The Aravali range in India is one of the oldest fold mountain systems in the world. The range has considerably worn down due to the processes of erosion. The Appalachians in North America and the Ural mountains in Russia (Figure 5.1) have rounded features and low elevation. They are very old fold mountains.


Block Mountains are created when large areas are broken and displaced vertically. The uplifted blocks are termed as horsts and the lowered blocks are called graben.

Sometimes the oasis may be abnormally large. Tafilalet Oasis in Morocco is a large oasis with an area of about 13,000 sq.km.


Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation  routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.

Background: Article 102 of the Constitution provides that  a person shall be disqualified from being chosen as a Member of Parliament (MP) if he holds an office of profit under the government of India or the government of a state. However, Parliament can declare by law that the holding of certain offices will not incur this disqualification. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959 lists certain offices of profit under the central and state governments,  which do not disqualify the holders from being an MP. The Chairperson of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
is exempted from disqualification as per this list.

Amendment: The Bill seeks to amend the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act,
1959.  The amendment will exclude the Chairperson of the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and the Chairperson of the National Commission for the Scheduled Tribes from incurring any disqualification  from being an MP.

The amendment to the 1959 Act reflects the change brought about by the Constitution (Eighty - ninth Amendment) Act, 2003.  The constitutional amendment bifurcated the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes into two independent Commissions: the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for the Scheduled Tribes.  Hence, the amendment to the 1959 Act was necessary to exclude the Chairperson of these two Commissions from incurring any disqualification from being an MP

Herbivory is a form of consumption in which an organism principally eats autotrophs such as plants, algae and photosynthesizingbacteria. More generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as primary consumers. Herbivory usually refers to animals eating plants; fungi, bacteria and protists that feed on living plants are usually termed plant pathogens (plant diseases), andmicrobes that feed on dead plants are saprotrophs.

Herbivores form an important link in the food chain, because they consume plants in order to ingest the carbohydrates produced by a plant  with the help of Photosynthesis. Carnivores in turn consume herbivores for the same reason, while omnivores can obtain their nutrients from either plants or animals. Due to a herbivore's ability to survive solely on tough and fibrous plant matter, they are termed the primary consumers in the food cycle (chain). Herbivory, carnivory, and omnivory can be regarded as special cases of Consumer-Resource Systems.

Soil textures are classified by the fractions of each soil separate (sand, silt, and clay) present in a soil. Classifications are typically named for the primary constituent particle size or a combination of the most abundant particles sizes, e.g. "sandy clay" or "silty clay." A fourth term, loam, is used to describe a roughly equal concentration  of sand, silt, and clay, and lends to the naming of even more classifications, e.g. "clay loam" or "silt loam."

Modern Methods of Irrigation


Modern methods of irrigation help us to use water economically. The main methods used are as follows:

(i) Sprinkler System: This system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining. Sprinkler is very useful for sandy soil

(ii) Drip system : In this system, the water falls drop by drop just at the position of the roots. So it is called drip system. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens and trees.
The system provides water to plants drop by drop. Water is not wasted at all. It is a  boon in regions where availability of water is poor.


Question  55

The Labrador Ocean current is cold current while the Gulf Stream is a warm  current.


Ocean currents  are streams of  water flowing  constantly  on  the  ocean surface in  definite directions. The  ocean currents may be warm or cold (Fig.  5.6). Generally, the warm ocean currents originate  near the equator  and move towards the poles. The cold currents carry water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower latitudes. The Labrador Ocean current is cold current while the Gulf Stream is a warm current. The ocean current influence the temperature conditions of the area.  Warm currents bring about warm temperature over land surface. The
areas where the warm and cold currents meet provide the best fishing grounds of the world. Seas

These regions Let’s do are marked for hot dry summers and mild rainy winters. Citrus fruits such as oranges, figs, olives and grapes are commonly cultivated here because people have removed the natural vegetation in order to cultivate what they want to. There isn’t much wildlife here.


Mediterranean trees adapt themselves to dry summers with the help of their thick barks and wax coated leaves which help them reduce transpiration.


Mediterranean regions are known as ‘Orchards of the world’ for their fruit cultivation.



Question 57

Solution: d)

Sexual assault:  Currently, “assault or use of criminal force to a woman  with the intent to outrage her modesty” is punishable under Section 354 of the IPC with 2 years imprisonment. The term outraging the modesty of a woman  is not defined in the IPC.  Thus, where penetration cannot be proved, the offence is categorized as defined under Section 354 of the IPC.

The Committee recommended  that non-penetrative forms of sexual contact should be regarded as sexual assault. The offence of sexual assault should be defined so as to include all forms of non-consensual non-penetrative touching of a sexual nature. The sexual nature of an act should be determined on the basis of the circumstances.   Sexual gratification as a  motive for the act should not be prerequisite for proving the offence.  The offence should be punishable with 5 years of imprisonment, or fine, or both.
Use  of  criminal  force  to  disrobe  a   woman should  be  punishable with  3  to  7  years of imprisonment.
Verbal  sexual assault: At  present, use of words or gestures to “insult  a  woman’s modesty” is punishable with 1 year of imprisonment or fine or both under Section 509 of the IPC.  This section should be repealed. The Committee has suggested that use of words, acts or gestures that create an unwelcome threat of  a  sexual nature should be termed as sexual assault and be
punishable for 1 year imprisonment or fine or both.

Troposphere: This layer is the most important layer of the atmosphere. Its average height  is 13 km. The air we breathe exists here. Almost all the weather phenomena like rainfall, fog and hailstorm occur in this layer.


Stratosphere: Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere. It extends up to a height  of 50 km. This layer is almost free from clouds and associated  weather phenomenon, making  conditions most ideal for flying aeroplanes.  One important feature of stratosphere is that  it contains a  layer of ozone gas. We have just learnt how it protects us from the harmful effect of the sun rays.


Mesosphere: This is the third layer of the atmosphere. It lies above the stratosphere. It extends up to the height of 80 km. Meteorites burn up in this layer on entering from the space.


Thermosphere: In thermosphere  temperature rises very rapidly with increasing height. Ionosphere is a part of this layer. It extends between 80-400 km. This  layer helps in radio transmission. In fact, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.

Exosphere: The upper most layer of the atmosphere is known as exosphere. This  layer has very thin air. Light gases like helium and hydrogen float into the space from here.

Question 67


Solution: d)



Slash and Burn is a way of cultivating land where farmers  clear a piece of land by slashing or cutting down trees and bushes. These are then burnt, which releases the nutrients into the soil. Now crops are grown in this cleared field for a few years.


After repeatedly using the patch of land, the soil loses its nutrients. So it is abandoned.
Then they clear another plot of land to plant. In the mean time young trees grow in the old field. In this way soil fertility is restored. People can then return to it and start cultivating it again.


Slash-and-char is an alternative  to slash-and-burn  that has a lesser effect on the environment. It is the practice of charring the biomass resulting from the slashing, instead of burning it as in the slash-and-burn practice. The resulting residue matter charcoal and biochar improves the soil.

Question 77


Solution: d)


Some methods of soil conservation are


Mulching: The bare ground between plants is covered with a layer of organic matter like straw. It helps to retain soil moisture.

Contour  barriers: Stones, grass, soil are used to build barriers along contours. Trenches are made in front of the barriers to collect water.

Rock dam: Rocks are piled up to slow down the flow of water. This prevents gullies and further soil loss.

Terrace farming: These are made on the steep slopes so that flat surfaces are available to grow crops. They can reduce surface run-off and soil erosion

Intercropping:  Different crops are grown in alternate  rows and are sown at  different times to protect the soil from rain wash.

Contour  ploughing: Ploughing parallel to the contours of a hill slope to form a natural  barrier for water to flow down the slope

Shelter  belts:  In  the coastal and dry regions, rows  of  trees are planted to check the wind movement to protect soil cover

Question 80


Solution: a)



The strong gravitational pull exerted by the sun and the moon on the earth’s surface causes the tides. The water of the earth closer to the moon gets pulled under the influence of the moon’s gravitational force and causes high tide. During the full moon and new moon days, the sun, the moon and the earth are in the same line and the tides are highest. These tides are called spring tides. But when the moon is in its first and last
quarter, the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite directions by the gravitational pull of
sun  and  earth resulting  in  low  tides. These  tides are called neap  tides. High  tides help in navigation.  They raise the water level close to the shores. This  helps the ships to arrive at the harbour more easily. The high tides also help in fishing. Many more fish come closer to the shore during the high tide. This enables fishermen to get a plentiful catch. The rise and fall of water due to tides is being used to generate electricity in some places.

Honey bees transform nectar into honey by a process of regurgitation  and evaporation. They store it as a primary  food source in wax honeycombs inside the beehive.

Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has approximately the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a  distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it over sugar and other sweeteners.[1] Most microorganisms do not grow in honey because of its low water activity of 0.6. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum,  which
can be dangerous  to infants, as the endospores can transform into toxin-producing  bacteria in infants' immature intestinal tracts, leading to illness and even death.

Water activity is defined as the partial vapor pressure of water in a  substance divided by the standard state partial vapor pressure of water. In the field of food science, the standard state is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. Using
this particular definition, pure distilled water  has a water activity of exactly one.
