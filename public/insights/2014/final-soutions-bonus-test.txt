Aestivation or æstivation is a state of animal dormancy, similar to hibernation, characterized by inactivity and a lowered metabolic rate, that is entered in response to high temperatures  and arid conditions.[1]  It takes place during times of heat and dryness, the hot dry season, which are often the summer months.

Invertebrate and vertebrate animals are known to enter this state to avoid damage from high temperatures and the risk of desiccation. Both terrestrial  and aquatic animals undergo aestivation.

3.   Solution: a)

Primary production is defined as the amount of biomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period by plants during photosynthesis. It is expressed in terms of weight (g–2) or energy (kcal m–2). The rate of biomass production is
called productivity.

It is expressed in terms of g–2 yr –1 or (kcal m–2) yr–1 to compare the productivity of different ecosystems. It can be divided into gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP). Gross primary productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants in respiration. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R), is the net primary productivity (NPP).

GPP – R = NPP

Net primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption to heterotrophs (herbiviores and decomposers). Secondary productivity is defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers.

Primary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting  a particular  area. It also depends on a variety of environmental factors, availability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants. Therefore, it varies in different types of ecosystems. The annual net primary productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons (dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per cent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only
55 billion tons. Rest of course, is on land.

4.   Solution: d)

Bt Cotton: Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes). B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular  phase of their growth. These crystals contain  a toxic insecticidal protein. Why does this toxin not kill the Bacillus? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial
cells and create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death of the insect.

Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and incorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton. The choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as most Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene named  cry. There are a number  of them, for example, the proteins encoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms that of cryIAb controls corn borer.

Biomes are climatically  and geographically defined as contiguous areas with similar
climatic conditions on the Earth, such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms and are often referred to as ecosystems. Some parts of the earth have more or less the same kind of abiotic and biotic factors spread over a large  area, creating  a typical ecosystem over that area. Such major ecosystems are termed as biomes. Biomes are defined by factors such as plant structures (such
as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant
spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation (quasi equilibrium state of the local ecosystem). An ecosystem has many biotopes and a biome is a major habitat type. A major habitat type, however, is a compromise, as it has an intrinsic inhomogeneity. Some examples of habitats are ponds, trees, streams, creeks, under rocks and burrows in the sand or soil.

Biotope is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of plants and animals. Biotope is almost synonymous with the term habitat, which is more commonly used in English-speaking countries. However, in some countries these two terms are distinguished:  the subject of a
habitat is a species or a population, the subject of a biotope  is a biological community

Biomes are often known in English by local names. For example, a temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as steppe in
central Asia, prairie in North America, and pampas in South America. Tropical grasslands are known as savanna in Australia, whereas in southern Africa they are known as certain kinds of veld (from Afrikaans).

8.  Solution: d)

Organisms occupy a place  in the natural surroundings  or in a community according to their feeding relationship with other organisms. Based on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific place in the food chain that is known as their trophic level. Producers belong to the first trophic level, herbivores
(primary consumer) to the second and carnivores  (secondary consumer) to the third.

9.  Solution: d)

All are correct.

An important characteristic of all communities is that composition and structure constantly change in response to the changing environmental conditions. This change is orderly and sequential, parallel with the changes in the physical environment. These changes lead finally to a community that is in near equilibrium
with the environment  and that is called  a climax community. The gradual and fairly predictable change in the species composition of a given area is called ecological succession. During succession some species colonise an area and their populations become more numerous, whereas populations of other species decline and even
disappear.

The entire sequence of communities that successively change in a given  area are called sere(s). The individual transitional communities are termed seral stages or seral communities. In the successive seral stages there is a change  in the diversity of species of organisms, increase in the number of species and organisms as well as an increase in the total biomass.

10. Solution: c) Light:
Since plants produce food through photosynthesis, a process which is only possible when sunlight is available as a source of energy, we can quickly understand the importance of light for living organisms, particularly autotrophs. Many species of small plants (herbs and shrubs) growing in forests are adapted to photosynthesise optimally under very low light conditions because they are constantly overshadowed by tall, canopied trees. Many plants are also dependent on sunlight
to meet their photoperiodic requirement for flowering. For many animals too, light is important in that they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light intensity and duration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging, reproductive  and migratory activities. The availability of light on land is closely linked with that of temperature since the sun is the source for both. But, deep (>500m) in the oceans, the environment is perpetually  dark and its inhabitants are not aware of the existence of a celestial source of energy called Sun. What, then is their source of energy?). The spectral quality of solar radiation is also important for life. The UV component of the spectrum is harmful to many organisms while not all the colour components of the visible spectrum are available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean.

Photoperiodism is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night. It occurs in plants and animals. Photoperiodism  can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of the light and dark periods. Here it should be emphasized that photoperiodic effects relate directly to the timing of both the light and dark periods.




11.  Solution: c)

Both the species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in their interactions with each other. In both parasitism and Predation only one species



http://insightsonindia.com                                         INSIGHTS                                                                   Page 5

benefits (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction is detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively).

The interaction where one species is benefitted and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed is called commensalism. In amensalism on the other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalisms share a common characteristic– the interacting species live closely together.

12. Solution: d)

The important point to note is that the amount of energy decreases at successive trophic levels. When any organism dies it is converted to detritus or dead biomass that serves as an energy source for decomposers.  Organisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level for their energy demands.

Each trophic level has a certain  mass of living material at a particular  time called as the standing crop. The standing crop is measured as the mass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. The biomass of a species is expressed in terms of fresh or dry weight. Measurement of biomass in terms of dry weight is more accurate. Why? The number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as the transfer of energy follows 10 per cent law – only 10 per cent of the energy is transferred to each trophic level from the lower trophic level. In nature, it is possible to have so many levels – producer, herbivore, primary carnivore, secondary carnivore in the grazing food chain.




13. Solution: b)

(Error in Question:  4th option should have been ‘coral bleaching’ instead of ‘their bleaching’)

It is decrease in ocean water pH which affects corals. Decrease in pH casues acidification of ocean water.

Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.[2] An estimated 30–
40% of the carbon dioxide released by humans into the atmosphere dissolves into
oceans, rivers and lakes. To achieve chemical equilibrium, some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid. Some of these extra carbonic acid molecules react with a water  molecule to give abicarbonate ion and a hydronium ion, thus

increasing ocean "acidity" (H+  ion concentration). Between 1751 and 1994 surface ocean pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14, representing  an increase of almost 30% in H+  ion concentration in the world's oceans. Available Earth System Models project that within the last decade ocean pH exceeded historical analogs and in combination with other ocean
biogeochemical changes could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and many ocean goods and services.

Increasing acidity is thought to have a range of possibly harmful consequences, such as depressing metabolic rate and immune response in some organisms, and
causing coral bleaching. However it may benefit some other species.

15. Solution: d)

Primary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting  a particular  area. It also depends on a variety of environmental factors, availability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants. Therefore, it varies in different types of ecosystems. The annual net primary productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons (dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per cent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only
55 billion tons. Rest of course, is on land.

In a reversal  of the pattern on land, in the oceans, almost all photosynthesis is performed by algae, with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups. Algae encompass a diverse range of organisms, ranging from single floating cells to attachedseaweeds. They include photoautotrophs from a variety of
groups. Eubacteria are important  photosynthetizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems, and while some archaea arephototrophic, none are known to utilise oxygen-evolving photosynthesis.[3] A number ofeukaryotes are significant

INSIGHTS MOCK TESTS - SOLUTIONS


contributors to primary production in the ocean, including green algae, brown algae and red algae, and a diverse group of unicellular groups. Vascular plants are also represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses.

Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the majority of primary production in the ocean is performed by free-living microscopic organisms called phytoplankton. Larger autotrophs, such as the seagrasses and macroalgae (seaweeds)  are generally confined to the littoral zone and adjacent shallow waters, where they can attachto the underlying substrate but still be within the photic zone. There are exceptions, such as Sargassum, but the vast majority of free-floating production takes place within microscopic organisms.

The factors limiting primary production in the ocean are also very different from those on land. The availability of water, obviously, is not an issue (though
its salinity can be). Similarly, temperature, while affecting metabolic rates (see Q10), ranges less widely in the ocean than on land because the heat capacity of seawater buffers temperature changes, and the formation of sea ice insulates it at lower temperatures. However, the availability of light, the source of energy for photosynthesis, and mineral nutrients, the building blocks for new growth, play crucial roles in regulating primary production in the ocean. Available Earth System Models suggest that ongoing ocean bio-geochemical  changes could trigger
reductions in ocean NPP between 3% and 10% of current values depending on the emissions scenario



16. Solution: d)


Composition and Distribution  of the Intestinal Microflora

The intestinal microflora is a complex ecosystem containing over 400 bacterial species. Anaerobes outnumber facultative anaerobes. The flora is sparse in the stomach and upper intestine, but luxuriant in the lower bowel. Bacteria occur both in the lumen and attached to the mucosa, but do not normally penetrate the bowel wall .

Metabolic Activities

Intestinal bacteria are a crucial component of the enterohepatic circulation in which metabolites that are conjugated  in the liver and excreted in the bile are deconjugated in the intestine by bacterial enzymes, then absorbed across the mucosa and returned to the liver in the portal circulation. Many drugs and endogenous compounds undergo enterohepatic circulation. Antibiotics that suppress the flora can alter the fecal excretion and hence the blood levels of these

compounds. The flora also plays a role in fiber digestion and synthesizes certain vitamins.

The  Intestinal Microflora

The intestinal microflora may prevent infection by interfering with pathogens. The flora includes low populations of potentially pathogenic organisms such
as Clostridium difficile. Antibiotics that upset the balance of the normal flora can favor both infection by exogenous pathogens and overgrowth  by endogenous pathogens. If the bowel wall is breached, enteric bacteria can escape into the peritoneum  and cause peritonitis and abscesses.

18. Solution: b)

The detritus food chain (DFC) begins with dead organic matter. It is made up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms, mainly fungi and bacteria. They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by degrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as saprotrophs (sapro: to decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive enzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic materials, which are subsequently  absorbed by them.

In an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow. As against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy flows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus food chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels: some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural  ecosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores. These natural interconnection of food chains make it a food web.

Mutualism: This interaction confers benefits on both the interacting species. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship between  a fungus and
photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria. Similarly, the mycorrhizae are associations
between fungi and the roots of higher plants. The fungi help the plant in the absorption of essential nutrients from the soil while the plant in turn provides the fungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates.

The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships. Plants need the help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their seeds. Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that plants expect from them. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for seed
dispersers. But the mutually beneficial system should also be safeguarded against
‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to steal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator species are tightly linked with one another. In many species of fig trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp. It means that a given fig species
can be pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species. The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing its larvae. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while searching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the
favour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.




20. Solution: d)

All are correct.



21. Solution: a)

Causes  of biodiversity losses:

The accelerated rates of species extinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human activities. There are four major causes (‘ The Evil Quartet ’ is the sobriquet used to describe them).

(i) Habitat loss and fragmentation:



http://insightsonindia.com                                         INSIGHTS                                                                Page 10
INSIGHTS MOCK TESTS - SOLUTIONS


This is the most important cause driving animals and plants to extinction. The most dramatic examples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests. Once covering more than 14 per cent of the earth’s land surface, these rain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent. They are being destroyed fast. By the time you finish reading this chapter, 1000 more hectares of rain forest would have been lost. The Amazon rain forest (it is so huge that it is called the ‘lungs of the planet’) harbouring
probably millions of species is being cut and cleared for cultivating soya beans or
for conversion to grasslands for raising beef cattle. Besides total loss, the degradation of many habitats by pollution also threatens the survival of many species. When large habitats are broken  up into small fragments due to various human activities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain animals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to population declines.

(ii) Over-exploitation:

Humans have always depended on nature for food and shelter, but when ‘need’ turns to ‘greed’, it leads to over-exploitation of natural resources. Many species extinctions in the last 500 years (Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon) were due to overexploitation by humans. Presently many marine fish populations around the world are over harvested, endangering the continued existence of some commercially important species.

(iii) Alien species invasions:

When alien species are introduced unintentionally  or deliberately for whatever purpose, some of them turn invasive, and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species. The Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led eventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of more than 200 species of cichlid fish in the lake. You must be familiar with the environmental damage caused and threat posed to our native species by invasive weed species like carrot grass (Parthenium), Lantana and water hyacinth (Eicchornia). The recent illegal introduction of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus for aquaculture purposes is posing a threat  to the indigenous catfishes in our rivers.

(iv) Co-extinctions:

When a species becomes extinct, the plant and animal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become extinct. When a host fish species becomes extinct,


http://insightsonindia.com                                         INSIGHTS                                                                Page 11

its unique assemblage of parasites also meets the same fate. Another example is the case of a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism where extinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology inmolecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular  DNA sequence.

Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis,PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety  of applications.[ These include DNA cloning for sequencing, DNA-based phylogeny, or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of hereditary diseases; the identification of genetic
fingerprints (used in forensic sciencesand paternity testing); and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases. In 1993, Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael Smith for his work on PCR.

The method relies on thermal cycling, consisting of cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting  and enzymatic replication of the
DNA. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region along with a DNA polymerase (after which the method is named) are key components to enable selective and repeated amplification.  As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template  for replication, setting in motion

25. Solution: b)

Thermoregulation is energetically expensive for many organisms. This is particularly true for small animals like shrews and humming birds. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative  to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside; then
they have to expend much energy to generate body heat through metabolism. This is the main reason why very small animals are rarely found in polar regions.




26. Solution: b)

The construction of the first recombinant DNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding  antibiotic resistance with a native plasmid (autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA) of Salmonella typhimurium. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid  which was responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at specific locations became possible with the discovery of the so-called ‘molecular scissors’– restriction enzymes. The cut piece of DNA was then linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as vectors to transfer the piece of DNA attached to it. You probably know that mosquito acts as an insect vector to transfer the
malarial parasite into human body.

In the same way, a plasmid  can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece of DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene with the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase, which acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created in vitro and is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into Escherichia coli, a bacterium  closely
related to Salmonella, it could replicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase

27. Solution: b)

Shivering is also a form of regulation by the body to maintain homesostasis. Conformation is a different concept, where organisms conform the external factors and either migrate to suitable regions or slip into dormancy.

(i) Regulate :

Some organisms are able to maintain homeostasis by physiological (sometimes behavioural also) means which ensures constant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, etc. All birds and mammals,  and a very few lower vertebrate and invertebrate species are indeed capable of such regulation (thermoregulation  and osmoregulation).  Evolutionary  biologists believe that the
‘success’ of mammals is largely due to their ability to maintain a constant  body temperature  and thrive whether they live in Antarctica or in the Sahara desert.

The mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate their body temperature are similar to the ones that we humans use. We maintain  a constant body temperature of – 370C. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely. The resulting evaporative cooling, similar to what happens with a desert cooler in operation, brings down the body temperature. In winter when the temperature is much lower than 370C, we start to shiver, a kind
of exercise which produces heat and raises the body temperature. Plants, on the other hand, do not have such mechanisms to maintain internal temperatures.

(ii) Conform  :

An overwhelming majority (99 per cent) of animals and nearly all plants cannot maintain  a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with
the ambient temperature. In aquatic animals, the osmotic concentration of the body fluids change with that of the ambient water osmotic concentration. These animals and plants are simply conformers. Considering the benefits of a constant  internal environment to the organism, we must ask why these conformers had not evolved to become regulators. Recall the human analogy we used above; much as they like, how many people can really afford an air conditioner? Many simply ‘sweat it out’

and resign themselves to suboptimal performance in hot summer months. Thermoregulation is energetically expensive for many organisms. This is particularly true for small animals like shrews and humming birds. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative  to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside; then
they have to expend much energy to generate body heat through metabolism. This is the main reason why very small animals are rarely found in polar regions. During the course of evolution, the costs and benefits of maintaining  a constant  internal environment  are taken into consideration. Some species have evolved the ability to
regulate, but only over a limited range of environmental conditions, beyond which they simply conform.

If the stressful external conditions are localised or remain only for a short duration, the organism has two other alternatives.

(iii) Migrate: The organism can move away temporarily from the stressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when stressful period is over. In human analogy, this strategy is like a person moving from Delhi to Shimla for the duration of summer. Many animals, particularly birds, during winter undertake long-distance migrations to more hospitable areas. Every winter the famous Keolado National Park (Bhartpur) in Rajasthan host thousands of migratory birds coming from Siberia and other extremely cold northern regions.

(iv) Suspend: In bacteria, fungi and lower plants, various kinds of thick-walled spores are formed  which help them to survive unfavourable conditions – these germinate on availability of suitable environment. In higher plants, seeds and some other vegetative reproductive  structures serve as means to tide over periods of stress besides helping in dispersal – they germinate to form new plants under favourable moisture and temperature  conditions. They do so by reducing their metabolic activity and going into a date of ‘dormancy’. In animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the stress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into hibernation during winter is an example of escape in time. Some snails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer–related problems-heat and desiccation. Under unfavourable conditions many zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter diapause, a stage of suspended development.

Temperature is the most ecologically relevant environmental factor. You are aware that the average temperature  on land varies seasonally, decreases progressively from the equator towards the poles and from plains to the mountain tops. It ranges from subzero levels in polar areas and high altitudes to >500C in tropical deserts in summer. There are, however, unique habitats such as thermal springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents where average temperatures exceed 1000 C. It is general knowledge  that mango trees do not and cannot grow in temperate countries like Canada and Germany,  snow leopards are not found in Kerala forests and tuna fish are rarely caught beyond tropical latitudes in the ocean. You can readily appreciate the significance of temperature to living organisms when you realise that it affects the kinetics of enzymes and through it the basal metabolism,  activity and other physiological functions of the organism. A few organisms can tolerate and thrive in
a wide range of temperatures (they are called eurythermal), but, a vast majority of
them are restricted to a narrow  range of temperatures (such organisms are called stenothermal). The levels of thermal tolerance of different species determine to a large extent their geographical distribution.

The Indian Cormorant  or Indian Shag (Phalacrocorax fuscicollis) is a member  of thecormorant family. It is found mainly along the inland waters of the Indian Subcontinent but extending west to Sind and east to Thailand and Cambodia. It is a gregarious species that can be easily distinguished from the similar sized Little Cormorant by its blue eye, small head with a sloping forehead  and a long narrow
bill ending in a hooked  tip.

The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter. It keeps changing in time, depending on various factors including food availability, predation pressure and reduce weather. In fact, it is these changes in population density that give us some idea of what is happening to the population – whether it is flourishing or declining. Whatever might be the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat during a given period, fluctuates due to changes in four basic

processes, two of which (natality and immigration)  contribute an increase in population density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease.

(i) Natality refers to the number of births during  a given period in thepopulation that are added to the initial density.

(ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a givenperiod.

(iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species thathave come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time periodunder consideration.

Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites. The most familiar examples of this group are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine fish are infested with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction.




32. Solution: d)

Detritivores (e.g., earthworm)  break down detritus into smaller particles. This process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, water- soluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated  as unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism.

It is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition operate simultaneously on the detritus. Humification and mineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil. Humification leads to accumulation of a dark  coloured amorphous substance called humus that is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition at an extremely slow rate. Being colloidal in nature it serves as a reservoir of nutrients. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release of inorganic nutrients occur by the process known as mineralisation

Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and climatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. Temperature and soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate decomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes. Warm and moist environment favour decomposition whereas low temperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition resulting in build up of organic materials.




33. Solution: a)

In most ecosystems, all the pyramids, of number, of energy and biomass are upright, i.e., producers are more in number and biomass than the herbivores, and herbivores are more in number  and biomass than the carnivores. Also energy  at a lower
trophic level is always more than  at a higher level.

There are exceptions to this generalisation: If you were to count the number of insects feeding on a big tree what kind of pyramid would you get? Now add an estimate of the number of small birds depending on the insects, as also the number of larger birds eating the smaller. Draw the shape you would get.

The pyramid of biomass in sea is also generally inverted because the biomass of fishes far exceeds that of phytoplankton.

The soil pH is a measure  of the acidity or alkalinity in soils.  A pH below 7
is acidic and above 7 is alkaline. Soil pH is considered a master  variable in soils as it controls many chemical processes that take place. It specifically affects plant

nutrient availability by controlling the chemical forms of the nutrient. The optimum pH range for most plants is between  5.5 and 7.0, however many plants have adapted to thrive at pH values outside this range.

Plants grown in acid soils can experience a variety  of symptoms including aluminium (Al), hydrogen (H), and/or manganese (Mn) toxicity, as well as potential nutrient deficiencies of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg).
Aluminium toxicity is the most widespread problem in acid soils. Aluminium is present in all soils, but dissolved Al3+ is toxic to plants; Al3+ is most soluble at low pH, above pH 5.2 little aluminum is in soluble form in most soils. Aluminium is not a plant  nutrient, and as such, is not actively taken up by the plants, but enters plant roots passively through osmosis. Aluminium damages roots in several ways: In root
tips and Aluminium interferes with the uptake of Calcium, an essential nutrient, as well as bind with phosphate and interfere with production of ATP and DNA, both of which contain phosphate. Aluminium can also restrict cell wall expansion causing roots to become stunted.




35. Solution: a)

Diapause, when referencing animal dormancy, is the delay in development in response to regularly and recurring periods of adverse environmental conditions. It is considered to be a physiological state of dormancy with very specific initiating and inhibiting conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means  to survive predictable, unfavorable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought or reduced food availability. Diapause is most often observed
in arthropods, especially insects, and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes.

Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition. While they do not rule out the occurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism is ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns. MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities.




38. Solution: b)

Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have proposed various hypotheses; some important ones are:

a.  Tropical environments, unlike temperate ones, are less seasonal, relatively more constant and predictable. Such constant environments promote niche specialisation  and lead to a greater  species diversity and
b.  There is more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to higher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater diversity
c.  Speciation is generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected to frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long evolutionary time for species diversification.

Allen’s rule states  that endotherms from colder climates usually have shorter limbs
(or appendages) than the equivalent animals from warmer climates.

Bergmann's rule is an ecogeographic  principle that states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic clade, populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments,  and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions.

A clade is by definition monophyletic, meaning it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism,  a population, or a species) and all its descendants. The ancestor can be known or unknown; any and all members of a clade can be extant or extinct.

Some organisms possess adaptations that are physiological which allow them to respond quickly to a stressful situation. If you had ever been to any high altitude place (>3,500m Rohtang Pass near Manali and Mansarovar, in China occupied Tibet) you must have experienced what is called altitude sickness. Its symptoms include nausea, fatigue and heart palpitations. This is because in the low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, the body does not get enough oxygen. But, gradually you get acclimatised and stop experiencing altitude sickness. How did your body solve this problem? The body compensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cell production, decreasing the binding capacity of hemoglobin and by increasing breathing rate. Many tribes live in the high altitude of Himalayas.
