35. Consider the following statements with reference to diapauses

1.   It is  the delay in development in  response to regularly and recurring periods of adverse environmental conditions.
2.   Under unfavourable  conditions many  zooplankton species  in lakes and ponds are  known to enter   diapause,  a     stage    of
suspended development.
3.  In insects diapauses is not at all observed as they adapt themselves to different environments through other mechanisms

36. Consider the following statements

1.  A   slow   growing   animal  like the elephant could    reach    an enormous  population if  there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat
2.   No population of any species in nature has its disposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth
3.  The carrying       capacity of      a
biological species in
an environment is                  the maximum  population size  of

the species  that  the environment can sustain indefinitely,         given          the food, habitat, water and     other necessities available in the environment.
4. A  population growing  in  a habitat with  limited  resources reaches a  final stage  when the
population density reaches the carrying capacity

Which  of the statements  given above is/are incorrect?

a.   1 and 2 Only b.  2 and 3 Only c.  2,3 and 4

37. With     reference    to     â€˜resource partitioningâ€™ between competing species, consider the following statements

1.   It  concurs   with   the  Gauseâ€™s
â€˜Competitive Exclusion Principleâ€™ which states that two closely  related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior  one will be eliminated eventually.
2.   According to it, if two species compete for the same resource,
they  could  avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times  for  feeding or different foraging patterns.

Which of the above statements is correct?

a.   1 Only
b.  2 Only c.  Both
d.  None

38. Tropical  environments have large biodiversity. Plausible reasons are


1. Tropical environments, unlike temperate ones,  are more seasonal, relatively less  constant and  unpredictable. Such environments promote niche specialisation  and lead to a greater species diversity
2. There is more solar energy available  in  the tropics,  which contributes to higher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater diversity
3. Speciation   is    generally      a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected  to frequent glaciations in the past,
tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long evolutionary time for species diversification.

Which   of  the  statements   given above is/are incorrect?

a.   1 and 3 Only b.  1 Only
c.  3 Only
d.  None

39. Consider the following statements about animal adaptations

1.   Allenâ€™s                rule               is an ecogeographic  principle  that states that within a broadly distributed      taxonomic clade,

http://insightsonindia.com                                                                                                                                                          Page 12
populations and species  of larger  size  are found in  colder environments, and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions.
2.   Bergmann's                            rule is
an ecogeographic  principle  that that endotherms  from      colder climates usually have shorter limbs (or appendages)  than the equivalent animals from warmer climates.
3.   Mammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and
limbs to minimise heat loss.
Which  of the statements  given above is/are incorrect?

a.   1 and 2 Only b.  1 and 3 Only c.  2 Only
d.  None

40. Altitude  sickness,  experienced in high altitude regions, is which type of adaptation?

a.   Morphological b.  Behavioural
c.  Physiological
