http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loess#Fertility

Loess is a geologically recent deposit of silt or material which is usually yellowish or brown in color and consisting of tiny mineral particles brought by wind to the places where they now lie. It is a product of past glacial activity in an area. It is a sedimentary deposit of mineral particles which are finer than sand but coarser than dust or clay, deposited by the wind. Loess is a type of silt which forms fertile topsoil in some parts of the world. Loess deposits are usually a few meters thick. One of the
key characteristics of these deposits is the ‘cat steps'. The soil has few clay particles to hold it together. It is composed mainly of quartz crystals which slide easily against each other, and is therefore very subject to erosion. Because of this, there are mini- earth slides, which form the steps.

King Mangarasa III proved himself more of a chef than a king. His treatise named
‘SoopaShastra’ on cookery of medieval Karnataka stands out to be the only compilation in a regional language during the medieval ages. King Mangarasa III belonged to the Chengalvu dynasty who were subordinate kings ruling under the suzerainty of Hoysala kings in the 16th century Karnataka. Mangarasa’s palace once stood in the present day Kallali in HunsurTaluk in Karnataka.

Mangarasa being a well-knownpoet, versified SoopaShastra in 385 stanzas running into six chapters during 15-16th century. The first chapter, ‘Pistakadhyaya’ describes as many as 50 wheat preparations. The next chapter called ‘Panakadhyaya’ deals with food-drinks. Mangarasa in old Kannadameant a good king (manga=good, beautiful; rasa=king). So there were Kings with the same name ruling the same kingdom but they were not related to each other - Mangarasa I wrote on poison; Mangarasa II came up with a dictionary; and Mangarasa IV became a chronicler of Kings in Kashmir.

Only two Sanskrit books - Bhima and Nala are devoted on cookery but fall short in being called profound works. Mangarasa has obtained help from both these books and besides got inspired by a character of an adept chef, Gouri, Hindu God Shiva’s spouse as mentioned in SkandaPurana. Two earlier Kannada literatures, Lingapurana and Lokopakara have more than fifty stanzas devoted on cookery.

12.Solution: d)

Constant  decline  in  soil  fertility  status,  mainly  due  to  nutrient  removal  by intensive cropping systems in amounts far-exceeding their replenishment through fertilizers and manures during past few decades, is considered one of the serious second-generation problems of Green Revolution.  Farmers often use nitrogenous fertilizers (mostly urea) or nitrogenous and complex fertilizers (mostly urea and DAP), ignoring the application of potash and other deficient nutrients.

On  the  other  hand,  multi-nutrient  deficiencies  have  already  emerged  and expanded in most of the soils. Soil analysis under different projects revealed widespread deficiency of at least six nutrients viz., Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potash  (K),  Sulphur  (S),  Zinc  (Zn)  and  Boron  (B)  in  different  parts  of  the country.  Some diagnostic surveys carried out in rice-wheat growing areas of north- western India revealed that farmers often apply greater than recommended rates of N to sustain the yield levels that were attained earlier with even less fertilizer use.

Urea, being most common N fertilizer, is indiscriminately used irrespective of scientific prescriptions.  Excessive use of urea leads to several adverse implications on soil, crop quality and overall ecosystem. Some major disadvantages of excessive/indiscriminate use of urea are listed as under:

It enhances mining of soil nutrients that are not applied or applied inadequately, thus leading to deterioration of soil fertility.   Such soils may require more fertilizers over time to produce optimum yields.

Nitrogen applied in excess of crop demand is lost through volatilization, denitrification and leaching.

Excessive use of N (urea) encourages climate change (when lost through denitrification) and groundwater pollution (when lost through leaching).  Increase in nitrate content of groundwater in some intensively-cropped areas has been reported, which is obviously due to leaching of nitrates beyond crop root zone.  Increase in nitrate content of groundwater is potentially harmful, as it is used for drinking purposes in most of the rural areas.

Fertilizer N (urea) application beyond recommended rates enhances crop succulence, thus making the plants prone to disease and pest infestation, and to lodging.

Unbalanced use of urea decreases N use efficiency, thus leads to increase in cost of production and lowering of net profits.




    
INSIGHTS  MOCK    TEST    SERIES    –    2015:    TEST    –    19    SOLUTIONS    WWW.INSIGHTSONINDIA.COM    

For   increasing   use   efficiency   of   N   and   other   nutrients,   profitability   and
environmental safety, fertilizer N (urea) application needs to be rationalized.  A few guidelines for rational use of N fertilizers are indicated below:

Fertilizer N (urea) application should be invariably balanced not only with P and K
but also with deficient secondary and micronutrients.

Soil test-based fertilizer prescriptions have to be adopted.  Farmers should insist for S and micronutrient testing, as NPK alone (without S and micronutrients) is no longer balanced fertilizer prescription.

Neem oil coated urea should be preferred over pilled urea, especially for basal dressing.

Losses of N are usually less when urea is top-dressed before irrigation.

Modified N scheduling using leaf color chart (LCC) gives better N use efficiency in crops.  LCC-based real-time N application needs to be promoted in the crops (like rice and wheat) for which LCC thresholds are available.

Conjoint use of organic manures and fertilizers may help curtailing the application of fertilizers including that of urea.

Inclusion of legumes may curtail fertilizer N (urea) requirement by 25-50%. Depending on cropping system and availability of irrigation, legumes could be introduced  as  catch  crop,  green  manures,  forage  crop,  break  crop  or  as  short duration grain crop.

Also, in 1934, with the formation of the Congress Socialist Party (CSP). the process of the consolidation of the Left forces received a significant push forward. The Communists, too, got the opportunity, by becoming members of the CSP to work in an open and legal fashion. This consolidation of the Left acted as a spur to the formation of an all-India body to coordinate the kisan movement, a process that was already under way through the efforts of N.G. Ranga and other kisan leaders. The culmination was the establishment of the All-India Kisan Congress in Lucknow in April 1936 which later changed its name to the AllIndia kisan Sabha. Swami Sahajanand, the militant founder of the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha (1929), was elected the President, and N.G. Ranga, the pioneer of the kisan movement in Andhra and a renowned scholar of the agrarian problem, the General Secretary. The first session was greeted in person by Jawaharlal Nehru. Other participants included
Ram Manohar Lohia, Sohan Singh Josh, Indulal Yagnik, Jayaprakash Narayan, Mohanlal Gautam, Kamal Sarkar, Sudhin Pramanik and Ahmed Din. The Conference resolved to bring out a Kisan Manifesto and a periodic bulletin edited by Indulal Yagnik. A Kisan Manifesto was finalized at the All-India Kisan Committee session in Bombay and formally presented to the Congress Working Committee to be incorporated into its forthcoming manifesto for the 1937 elections. The Kisan Manifesto considerably influenced the agrarian programme adopted by the Congress at its Faizpur session, which included demands for fifty per cent reduction in land revenue and rent, a moratorium on debts, the abolition of feudal levies, security of tenure for tenants, a living wage for agricultural labourers, and the recognition of peasant unions.

Hot spring, also called thermal spring, spring with water at temperatures substantially higher than the air temperature of the surrounding region. Most hot springs discharge groundwater that is heated by shallow intrusions of magma (molten rock) in volcanic areas. Some thermal springs, however, are not related to volcanic activity. In such cases, the water is heated by convective circulation: groundwater percolating downward reaches depths of a kilometre or more where the temperature of rocks is high because of the normal temperature gradient of the Earth’s crust—about 30 °C (54 °F) per kilometre in the first 10 km (6 miles).

The National Commission for SCs and STs came into being consequent upon passing of the 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1990. The Commission was established under Article 338 of the Constitution with the objective of monitoring all the safeguards provided for the SCs and STs under the Constitution or other laws.

Geographically and culturally, the STs are different from the SCs and their problems are also different from those of SCs. In 1999, a new Ministry of Tribal Affairs was created to provide a sharp focus to the welfare and development of the STs. It was felt necessary that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs should co-ordinate all activities relating to the STs as it would not be administratively feasible for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to perform this role

The separate National Commission for STs came into existence in 2004. It consists of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and three other members.

In November 1927, Jawaharlal and Motilal visited the Soviet Union. On his return, Jawaharlal wrote a series of articles for the Hindu which were also published in book form. His reaction was very positive and idealistic and was reflected in the lines he put on the title page of the book: ‘Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven.’ In 1928 and after Nehru 9 repeatedly praised the Soviet Union ‘as the greatest opponent of imperialism,’ this admiration for the Soviet Union was to deepen as he came more and more under the influence of Marxism. At Lucknow, in
1936, he said that though he was pained and disagreed with much that was
happening in the Soviet Union, he looked upon ‘that great and fascinating unfolding of a new order and a new civilization as the most promising feature of our dismal age.’ In fact, ‘if the future is full of hope it is largely because of Soviet Russia.’ The mass trials and purges of Stalin’s opponents in the 1930s repelled him, but he still retained his faith in the Soviet regime, especially as, in his view, it ‘stood as the one real effective bulwark against fascism in Europe and Asia.’

Financial repression on the asset side of the balance sheet is created by the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirement that forces banks to hold government securities, and priority sector lending (PSL) that forces resource deployment in less than fully efficient ways. Financial repression on the liability side has arisen from high inflation since 2007, leading to negative real interest rates, and a sharp reduction in households’ financial savings.

As India exits from liability-side repression with declining inflation, the time may be appropriate for addressing its asset-side counterparts.

In 1921, the Congress congratulated the Burmese people on their struggle for freedom. Burma was at that time a part of India, but the Congress announced that free India favoured Burma’s independence from India. Gandhiji wrote in this context in 1922: ‘1 have never been able to take pride in the fact that Burma has been made part of British India. It never was and never should be. The Burmese have a civilization of their own.’ In 1924, the Congress asked the Indian settlers in Burma to demand no separate rights at the cost of the Burmese people.




53.           Solution: a)

Igneous rocks are formed deep inside Earth's crust (intrusive rocks) or at the surface (extrusive rocks). As molten rock (known as magma) below the surface cools, the liquid material begins to solidify into minerals of differing sizes and compositions. Generally, the longer the cooling time, the larger the mineral crystals can grow. Trapped deep in the Earth, magma is allowed to cool slowly. Examples of intrusive rocks are granite and gabbro. Granite is made up of three common minerals - quartz, mica and feldspar - and when viewed from a distance appear tan, pinkish or gray, depending on the concentrations and grain sizes of the three minerals.

This rock is very widely used as a building material, due to its abundance and strength. Gabbro has a lower quartz content than granite, and is therefore much darker. Liquid rock that reaches the surface cools very quickly. As a result of this immediate cooling, the crystals produced are extremely small. These tiny-grained minerals tend to give these extrusive rocks a rather opaque, homogenous color.

All of the world's sea floors are produced in this manner of rapid cooling, and the dark-gray, heavy rock produced is called basalt. Andesite (named after the Andes Mountains in South America) is a cousin to basalt in that it is also volcanic in nature, but is lighter-colored due to the decreased concentration of darker minerals.

The Constitution (Article 149) authorises the Parliament to prescribe the duties and powers of the CAG in relation to the accounts of the Union and of the states and of any other authority or body.

Accordingly, the Parliament enacted the CAG’s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) act, 1971. This Act was amended in 1976 to separate accounts from audit in the Central government. The duties and functions of the CAG as laid down by the Parliament and the Constitution are:

1. He audits the accounts related to all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India, consolidated fund of each state and consolidated fund of each union territory having a Legislative Assembly.

2. He audits all expenditure from the Contingency Fund of India and the Public Account of India as well as the contingency fund of each state and the public account of each state.

In 1937, Japan launched an attack on China. The Congress passed a resolution condemning Japan and calling upon the Indian people to boycott Japanese goods as a mark of their sympathy with the Chinese people. At its Haripura session in early
1938, the Congress reiterated this call while condemning ‘the aggression of a brutal
imperialism in China and horrors and frightfulness that have accompanied it.’ It warned that the invasion of China was ‘fraught with the gravest consequences for the future of the world peace and of freedom in Asia.’ As an expression of its solidarity with the Chinese people, 12 June was celebrated throughout India as China Day. The Congress also sent a medical mission, headed by Dr. M. Atal, to work with the Chinese armed forces. One of its members, Dr. Kotnis, was to lay down his life working with the Eighth Route Army under Mao ZeDong’s command.

The role of CAG in the auditing of public corporations is limited. Broadly speaking, his relationship with the public corporations falls into the following three categories:

(i) Some corporations are audited totally and directly by the CAG, for example, Damodar Valley Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Air India, Indian Airlines Corporation, and others.

(ii) Some other corporations are audited by private professional auditors who are appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the CAG. If necessary, the CAG can conduct supplementary audit. The examples are, Central Warehousing Corporation, Industrial Finance Corporation, and others.

(iii) Some other corporations are totally subjected to private audit. In other words, their audit is done exclusively by private professional auditors and the CAG does not come into the picture at all. They submit their annual reports and accounts directly to the Parliament. Examples of such corporations are Life Insurance Corporation of India, Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India, Food Corporation of India, and others.

Attracted by the Soviet Union and its revolutionary commitment, a large number of Indian revolutionaries and exiles abroad made their way there. The most well-known and the tallest of them was M.N. Roy, who along with Lenin, helped evolve the Communist International’s policy towards the colonies. Seven such Indians, headed by Roy, met at Tashkent in October 1920 and set up a Communist Party of India. Independently of this effort, as we have seen, a number of left-wing and communist groups and organizations had begun to come into existence in India after 1920. Most of these groups came together at Kanpur in December 1925 and founded an all-India organization under the name the Communist Party of India (CPI).

Many countries before, including Japan in the aftermath of the real estate and equity boom of the late 1980s, have experienced over-extended corporate balance sheets. However, there is something fundamentally Indian about this phenomenon.

First, the debt overhang of the corporate sector is accompanied by a relatively high growth of around 6 to 7 per cent. Second, it has been accompanied by high inflation (instead of the price deflation in the Japanese example). Third, the public sector is

According to Census 2011, India has 55 million potential workers between the ages of 15 and 35 years in rural areas. At the same time, the world is expected to face a shortage of 57 million workers by 2020. This presents a historic opportunity for India to transform its demographic surplus into a demographic dividend. The Ministry of Rural Development implements DDU-GKY to drive this national agenda for inclusive growth, by developing skills and productive capacity of the rural youth from poor families.

There are several challenges preventing India’s rural poor from competing in the modern market, such as the lack of formal education and marketable skills. DDU- GKY bridges this gap by funding training projects benchmarked to global standards, with   an   emphasis   on   placement,   retention,   career   progression   and   foreign placement.

The stalling rate of projects has been increasing at an alarmingly high rate in the last five years, and the rate is much higher in the private sector.

The data shows that manufacturing and infrastructure dominate in the private sector, and manufacturing dominates in total value of stalled projects even over infrastructure. The government’s stalled projects are predominantly in infrastructure. Unfavourable market conditions (and not regulatory clearances) are stalling a large number of projects in the private sector, and in contrast regulatory reasons explain bulk of stalling in the public sector. Also, clearing the top 100 stalled projects will address 83 per cent of the problem of stalled projects by value.

In order for a sector to offer transformational possibilities, it must not only be characterised by high levels and growth rates of productivity, it must also absorb resources from the rest of the economy. But in order to do so, the sector’s use of inputs must be aligned with the country’s comparative advantage.

While Planning Commission enjoyed the powers to allocate funds to ministries and state governments, NITI Aayog will be an advisory body, or a think-tank. Under Planning Commission, States' role was limited to the National Development Council and annual interaction during Plan meetings and the commission reported to National Development Council that had state chief ministers and lieutenant governors of UTs. But Niti Aayog’s Governing Council has state chief ministers and lieutenant governors as the all powerful body. Under Niti Aayog states are consulted while making policy and deciding on funds allocation. Final policy would be a result of thatconsultations unlike under Planning Commission when policy was formed by the commission and states were then consulted about allocation of funds. While Niti Aayog is a think-tank and does not have the power to impose policies, Planning Commission decided policies for states and tied allocation of funds with projects it approved, a methodology driven by "one size fits all" concept.

The Congress Ministries resigned in October 1939 because of the political crisis brought about by World War 11. But Gandhiji welcomed the resignations for another reason — they would help cleanse the Congress of the ‘rampant corruption.’ He wrote to C. Rajagopalachari on 23 October 1939: ‘1 am quite clear in my mind that what has happened is best for the cause. It is a bitter pill I know. But it was needed. It will
drive away all the parasites from the body. We have been obliged to do wrong things
which we shall be able to avoid.’ The resignations produced another positive effect. They brought the Left and the Right in the Congress closer because of a common policy on the question of participation in the war.

Here are the steps

•   Fertilizer N (urea) application should be invariably balanced not only with P
and K but also with deficient secondary and micronutrients.
•   Soil test-based fertilizer prescriptions have to be adopted. Farmers should insist for S and micronutrient testing, as NPK alone (without S and micronutrients) is no longer balanced fertilizer prescription.
•   Neem oil coated urea should be preferred over pilled urea, especially for basal dressing.
•   Losses of N are usually less when urea is top-dressed before irrigation.
•   Modified N scheduling using leaf color chart (LCC) gives better N use efficiency in crops. LCC-based real-time N application needs to be promoted in the crops (like rice and wheat) for which LCC thresholds are available.
•   Conjoint use of organic manures and fertilizers may help curtailing the application of fertilizers including that of urea.
•   Inclusion of legumes may curtail fertilizer N (urea) requirement by 25-50%.
Depending on cropping system and availability of irrigation, legumes could be introduced as catch crop, green manures, forage crop, break crop or as short duration grain crop.

Among the various groups that participated in the national movement were several individual capitalists who joined the Congress. They fully identified with the movement, went to jails and accepted the hardships that were the lot of Congressmen in the colonial period. The names of Jamnalal Bajaj, Vadilal Lallubhai Mehta, Samuel Aaron, Lala Shankar Lal, and others are well known in this regard.
There were other individual capitalists who did not join the Congress but readily gave
financial and other help to the movement. People like G.D. Birla, Ambalal Sarabhai and Waichand Hirachand, fall into this category. There were also a large number of smaller traders and merchants who at various points came out in active support of the national movement. On the other hand, there were several individual capitalists or sections of the class who either remained neutral towards the Congress and the national movement or even actively opposed it.

How trains come to a stop?

We always wonder how trains run and how they are stopped. It is easy to understand how a car comes to a stop when the driver applies the brake using the brake pedal. Cars use hydraulic brakes whereas most of the trains in India use pneumatic brakes or air brakes as they are commonly called. These coaches are generally marked with an A or AB with the coach number. The trains can be stopped by the driver or by the passengers by alarm chain pulling (ACP).

In the Air Brake system, compressed air is used for operating the brake system. These brakes can be the conventional types or directly mounted on the bogies of the coaches. The latest design is the Disc Brake System (DBS) found in LHB coaches and is similar to what is found in automobiles. The atmospheric air is compressed in the locomotive upto 10 kg/cm2 and supplied at a pressure of 6/5 kg/cm2 to the train. It is carried across the whole length of the train through two pipes at the bottom of the coaches. When the brakes are applied the pressure in the 5kg pipe (the brake pipe) gets depleted proportionately and this causes the air to enter the brake cylinders which push a piston. The brake blocks are connected through a linkage and the piston movement causes them to stick to the wheels and stop the train by friction.




    
INSIGHTS  MOCK    TEST    SERIES    –    2015:    TEST    –    19    SOLUTIONS    WWW.INSIGHTSONINDIA.COM    
The loss in pressure is made good by the air in the 6kg/cm2 pipe called the feed pipe. In case of disc brake system the pads attached to the discs are used to stop the train.














DBS is micro processor controlled and an advanced version of Air Brake system. It is essential for high speeds of 160kmph plus. It is superior in terms of reduced braking distance, higher wheel life due to reduced frequency of wheel turning, and reduced maintenance, less braking noise and higher efficiency due to simple brake rigging. The main characteristics of DBS are 02 discs mounted on each axle as shown in picture below:


















Disc Brake Systm                                                                   Emergency Brake Handle







When the passenger pulls the alarm chain shown above located near the seat it causes the pressure in the brake pipe to fall down giving an indication to the driver and stopping the train. A valve on the coach called the PEASD (passenger emergency alarm signal device) operates and the sound of the escaping air can be heard from the coach. Also a light near the door glows and indicates the location of the affected coach.
What does an unscheduled stoppage of a train by ACP mean to the public?

Have you ever wondered why trains are often delayed? Analysis shows that ACP contributes to 4% of the punctuality loss cases on Indian Railways. Imagine the social costs of the time delays to about 1500 passengers in a train when one pulls the chain for a valid or often illegitimate reason. Apart from this time loss, calculations show that for an extra stoppage of a 24 coach train travelling at 110 Kmph, the locomotive




    
INSIGHTS  MOCK    TEST    SERIES    –    2015:    TEST    –    19    SOLUTIONS    WWW.INSIGHTSONINDIA.COM    
consumes  an  additional  amount  of  approximately  130litres of  diesel  fuel.  This amounts to a loss of 8500 rupees as well as the increase in avoidable atmospheric pollution. As responsible citizens we should abstain from using ACP and should sensitize others not to do the same. The penalty for unauthorized use of the alarm chain is Rs.1000 and/or imprisonment up to three months.

Apart from this we need to realize that the train requires about one kilometer to stop due to its sheer momentum. It is for this reason that in spite of the driver being vigilant there are accidents on unmanned level crossings when trespassers break the rules and expect the train to stop immediately on seeing them.

As responsible citizens and enlightened green passengers we should refrain from using the ACP unless there is a dire emergency. It may be worthwhile to contact the railway staff on the train to solve the problem at hand.
