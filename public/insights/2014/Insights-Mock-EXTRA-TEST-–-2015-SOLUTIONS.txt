1.  Solution: c)

The name for Napalm which is the original compound was given due to the orange coloured barrel carrying the compound!!!!
During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly 20,000,000 U.S. gallons (75,700,000 L) of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of the aerial defoliation program known as Operation Ranch Hand
The Environmental Modification Convention prohibits the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.
Although in at the Geneva Disarmament Convention of 1978, Article 2(4) Protocol III to the weaponry convention has "The Jungle Exception", which prohibits states from attacking forests or jungles "except if such natural elements are used to cover, conceal or camouflage combatants or military objectives or are military objectives themselves" this voids any protection of any military or civilians from a napalm attack or something like agent Orange and is clear that it was designed to cater to situations like U.S. tactics in Vietnam. This clause has still yet to be revised

•   Sulfur may be present in various fossil fuels at varying levels of concentration and in various forms. Sulfur is found in fossil fuels in elemental form, in molecular form attached to hydrocarbons and as hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S).
•   Combustion of sulfur contained in fossil fuels generates pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. Environmental regulations at various locations have specified different limits on the sulfur content on marketed fuels. Also, processing of high sulfur containing fossil fuels into end product fuels is a costly affair due to corrosive action of sulfur on processing equipments. Therefore, low sulfur containing fossil fuels are usually in high demand and fetch a high price.
•   Sulfur content is usually measured in weight percentage (wt %) or in parts per million by weight (ppm wt). Crude oil containing less than 0.5 wt % of sulfur is considered to have low sulfur content and is known as 'sweet crude oil'. Higher sulfur content than 0.5 wt % results in crude oil being known as 'sour crude oil'.
•   Most of this sulfur content in crude oil occurs in molecular form attache to the hydrocarbons. Small amount is contained as elemental sulfur and in
the form of hydrogen sulfide gas.

•   Usually the sulfur in the form of hydrogen sulfide is separated from hydrocarbons and recovered as elemental sulfur in the sulfur recovery unit (SRU) of a refinery. This sulfur is then sold by the refiners to fertilizer manufacturers.
•   Coal containing less than 1 wt % of sulfur is considered low sulfur containing fuel, higher than 1 wt % sulfur concentration is considered high for coal.

The Arctic is global warming's canary in the coal mine. It's a highly sensitive region, and it's being profoundly affected by the changing climate. Most scientists view what's happening now in the Arctic as a harbinger of things to come.














since 1979, the size of the summer polar ice cap has shrunk more than 20 percent. (Illustration from NASA)

Average temperatures in the Arctic region are rising twice as fast as they are elsewhere in the world. Arctic ice is getting thinner, melting and rupturing. For example, the largest single block of ice in the Arctic, the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, had been around for 3,000 years before it started cracking in 2000. Within two years it had split all the way through and is now breaking into pieces.

The polar ice cap as a whole is shrinking. Images from NASA satellites show that the area of permanent ice cover is contracting at a rate of 9 percent each decade. If this trend continues, summers in the Arctic could become ice-free by the end of the century.

5.  Solution: d)




















The dispersal of volcanic aerosols has a drastic effect on Earth's atmosphere. Follow an eruption, large amounts of sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrochloric acid (HCL) and ash are spewed into Earth's stratosphere. HCL, in most cases, condenses with water vapor and is rained out of the volcanic cloud formation. SO2 from the cloud is transformed into sulphuric acid, H2SO4. The sulphuric acid quickly condenses, producing aersol particles which linger in the atmosphere for long periods of time. The interaction of chemicals on the surface of aerosols, known as heterogeneous chemistry, and the tendency of aerosols to increase levels of chlorine gas react with nitrogen in the stratopshere, is a prime contributor to stratospheric ozone destruction.

Oil spill,leakage of petroleum onto the surface of a large body of water. Oceanic oil spills became a major environmental problem in the 1960s, chiefly as a result of intensified petroleum exploration and production on continental shelves and the use of supertankers capable of transporting more than 500,000 metric tons of oil. Spectacular oil spills from wrecked or damaged supertankers are now rare because of stringent shipping and environmental regulations. Nevertheless, thousands of minor
and several major oil spills related to well discharges and tanker operations are

reported each year, with the total quantity of oil released annually into the world’s oceans exceeding one million metric tons. The unintentional or negligent release of used gasoline solvents and crankcase lubricants by industries and individuals greatly aggravates the overall environmental problem. Combined with natural seepage from the ocean floor, these sources add oil to the world’s waterways at the rate of 3.5 million to 6 million metric tons a year.

Oil-spill damage
The costs of oil spills are considerable in both economic and ecological terms. Oil on ocean surfaces is harmful to many forms of aquatic life because it prevents sufficient amounts of sunlight from penetrating the surface, and it also reduces the level of dissolved oxygen. Crude oil ruins the insulating and waterproofing properties of feathers and fur, and thus oil-coated birds and marine mammals may die from hypothermia. Moreover, ingested oil can be toxic to affected animals, and damage to their habitat and reproductive rate may slow the long-term recovery of animal populations from the short-term damage caused by the spill itself. Damage to plant life can be considerable as well; saltwater marshes and mangroves are two notable shore ecosystems that frequently suffer from oil spills. If beaches and populated shorelines are fouled, tourism and commerce may be severely affected, as may power plants and other utilities that either draw on or discharge into seawater at the shore. One of the industries most affected by oil spills is fishing. Major oil spills are frequently followed by the immediate suspension of commercial fishing, at the least to prevent damage to vessels and equipment but also to prevent the catch and sale of fish or shellfish that may be contaminated.
The immediate environmental effects of oil spills have been readily identified, but
their long-term impact on the ecological system of an affected area is more difficult
to assess. The cost of paying compensation to individuals and communities damaged by oil spills has been a major incentive to reduce the chances of such events taking place in the future.

Oil-spill cleanup
As yet, no thoroughly satisfactory method has been developed for cleaning up major oil spills, though the spectacular spills of the last decades of the 20th century called forth great improvements in technology and in the management of coordinated responses. Essentially, responses to oil spills seek to contain the oil and remove enough of it so that economic activity can resume and the natural recovery processes of the marine environment can take over. Floating booms can be placed around the source of the spill or at entrances to channels and harbours to reduce the spreading
of an oil slick over the sea surface. Skimming, a technique that, like the use of booms, is most effective in calm waters, involves various mechanisms that physically
separate the oil from the water and place the oil into collection tanks. Another approach is to use various sorbents (e.g., straw, volcanic ash, and shavings of polyester-derived plastic) that absorb the oil from the water. Where appropriate, chemical surfactants and solvents may be spread over a slick in order to accelerate its
natural dispersion into the sea. Onshore removal of oil that has penetrated sandy

Landfarming is a full-scale bioremediation technology performed in the
upper soil zone or in biotreatment cells. Contaminated soils, sediments, or sludges are incorporated into the soil surface and periodically turned over (tilled) to aerate the mixture.

Soil conditions are often controlled to optimize the rate of contaminant degradation. Conditions normally controlled include:

•    Moisture content (usually by irrigation or spraying).

•    Aeration (by tilling the soil with a predetermined frequency, the soil is mixed and aerated).

•    pH (buffered near neutral pH by adding crushed limestone or agricultural lime).

•    Other amendments (e.g., Soil bulking agents, nutrients, etc.). Factors that may limit the applicability and effectiveness of the process include:
•   large space requirements
•   the conditions advantageous for biological degradation of contaminants are largely uncontrolled, which increases the length of time to complete remediation, particularly for recalcitrant compounds
•   inorganic contaminants are not biodegraded
•   The potential of large amounts of particulate matter released by operations
•   The presence of metal ions may be toxic to microbes and may leach from the contaminated soil into the ground.

•   In India, under the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger, ‘in-­‐‑ situ’ conservation of tiger is supported in designated tiger reserves of 17 tiger States, since the species breeds well under favourable habitat conditions.
•   There are ways of ex-situ conservation of tigers in Zoos. The first thing is low population. We understand that the tigers in zoo would be the captive tigers. The Captive population of Tigers, large or small, are at some risk of extinction.
•   The smaller the population, the more likely it will occur. To counter these issues , the zoos can be grown larger, by building new facilities, and by developing offsite breeding centres for endangered species.
•   Zoos can also expand their captive carrying capacity by developing assisted reproductive technology, specifically aimed at embryo transfer, artificial insemination and gamete freezing. If successful, even moderately, zoos could increase the effective size of a few hundred living animals to thousands of potential animals by cryopreservation of genetic material.

Thawing Permafrost

Permafrost refers to a layer of soil or rock that is frozen all year round. Permafrost is found throughout much of Alaska, parts of Canada, and other countries in the far north. You might think a place with permafrost would be barren, but plants can still grow in the soil at the surface, which is not frozen during warmer parts of the year. However, there may be a thick layer of permafrost underneath. As air temperature rises, so does the temperature of the ground, which can cause permafrost to thaw (or
melt).

What's happening now?

Ground temperatures have increased throughout Alaska since the late 1970s, and permafrost has already thawed in many places.

What will happen in the future?





















Source: Adapted from U.S. Global Change Research Program (2009). As temperatures keep getting warmer, permafrost will continue to thaw. For example, the map on the right shows how permafrost in northwestern Alaska could
change by the year 2100.

Why does it matter?

When permafrost melts, the land above it sinks or changes shape. Sinking land can damage buildings and infrastructure such as roads, airports, and water and sewer

pipes. It also affects ecosystems. For example, the top photo shows a forest where the trees are leaning or falling over because the permafrost underneath them has melted.

Another reason to be concerned about permafrost is because it has a lot of carbon trapped inside. As permafrost thaws, this carbon is released to the atmosphere in the form of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. This process leads to more climate change and is an example of a positive feedback loop, which happens when warming causes changes that lead to even more warming.

The main cause of coral bleaching is heat stress resulting from high sea temperatures.Temperature increases of only one degree celsius for only four weeks can trigger bleaching events.
If these temperatures persist for longer periods (eight weeks or more) corals begin to die. High water temperatures can affect reefs at regional and global scale.
Other stressors can also cause bleaching, including freshwater inundation (low
salinity) and poor water quality from sediment or pollutant run-off.






























19.Solution: d)

Oligotrophic lakes are those that are unproductive: net primary production is only between 50 and 100 milligrams of carbon per square metre per day, nutrients are in poor supply, and secondary production is depressed.

In the early stages a lake contains little organic material and has a poorly developed littoral zone. Particularly in temperate zones, such conditions favour plentiful oxygen content, and the lake is said to be oligotrophic. As erosion progresses and as lake enrichment and organic content increase, the lake may become sufficiently productive to place an excessive demand upon the oxygen content. When periods of oxygen depletion occur, a lake is said to be eutrophic. An
intermediate stage in this course of events is called mesotrophy.

All fluorescent lamps emit some UV. Typical fluorescent lamps, including CFLs, which consumers would encounter, emit very low levels of UV. In order to measure any UV radiation from these lamps, very sensitive measuring equipment must be used.

Like traditional tube-style fluorescent lamps, CFLs contain a small amount of mercury. It is the use of this small amount of mercury that allows any fluorescent lamp to produce visible illumination at much higher efficiency levels than incandescent lighting. Typical household CFLs contain less than 5 mg of mercury, which is a sphere about the size of the tip of a pen. CFLs do not emit mercury as they operate. The only way mercury could be emitted from a CFL would be if the outer glass tubing that contains the mercury were to break.

Since time immemorial, India has possessed a rich traditional knowledge of ways and means practiced to treat diseases afflicting people.

Documentation of this existing knowledge, available in public domain, on various traditional systems of medicine has become imperative to safeguard the sovereignty of this traditional knowledge and to protect it from being misappropriated in the
form of patents on non-original innovations, and which has been a matter of national concern.

India fought successfully for the revocation of turmeric and basmati patents granted by United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and neem patent granted by European Patent Office (EPO).

As a sequel to this, in 1999, the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy-(AYUSH), erstwhile Department of Indian System of Medicine and Homoeopathy (ISM&H) constituted an inter-disciplinary Task Force, for creating an approach paper on establishing a Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL).The project TKDL was initiated in the year 2001.

TKDL provides information on traditional knowledge existing in the country, in languages and format understandable by patent examiners at International Patent Offices (IPOs), so as to prevent the grant of wrong patents. TKDL thus, acts as a bridge between the traditional knowledge information existing in local languages and the patent examiners at IPOs.

TKDL is a collaborative project between Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Ministry of Science and Technology and Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and is being implemented at CSIR. An inter-disciplinary team of Traditional Medicine (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Yoga) experts, patent examiners, IT experts, scientists and technical officers are involved in creation of TKDL for Indian Systems of Medicine.

The Green India Mission is one of eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. It aims to increase forest cover on 5 million hectares (ha) of forest/non-forest land and improve the quality of forest cover on another 5 million ha. Funding for the scheme will come from the Plan outlay and convergence with the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee Act, the compensatory afforestation management and planning authority, and the national afforestation programme. The Union government will provide 90% of the funds for implementing the scheme in the north-eastern states, and 75% of the funds for other states. State governments will meet the balance requirement.

the mission will also focus on adaptation of forest-dependent communities. It aims to improve the livelihoods of about 3 million households living in and around forest areas.

the mission goes against the Forest Rights’ Act (FRA) by seeking to empower the JFMCs instead of the gram sabhas. “In many areas, JFMC are conflicting with FRA. It appears that there are two sets of framework coming from the Central government—on one hand, they want to empower gram sabhas through FRA, and on other hand, it continues with the status quo on JFMCs and forest bureaucracy,

Another likely problem is that plantation of trees under the new mission might encroach over land cultivated by tribals, Dash said. “Restoration of ecosystem is one thing and plantation is another. The same land that is used by adivasis (tribals) to cultivate food crops might be taken over if the focus is on plantations by the forest department.

Ethanol has a lower energy density than gasoline hence 100% ethanol cannot be used as a fuel. Also, it has a higher octane rating, which improves the compression ratio of engine which is better for increased thermal efficiency.

1.   The major advantage of Ethanol is that it has a higher octane rating than ethanol-­‐‑free gasoline. The Ethanol increases engine's compression ratio for increased thermal efficiency. Further, at higher altitude locations, a few countries a a mandatory mix of gasoline and ethanol to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.
2.   However, higher octane ratio makes higher compression ratios that

will make gasoline engines subject to engine knocking. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to retard the timing. So both the above are the reasons that Ethanol is blended in Gasoline.
3.   As   per   the   Government   decision,   after   ascertaining   the   actual availability of ethanol in the country, percentage of blend from 0-10% would be recommended area-wise by the working group of officers constituted for the purpose.

Degradation is in the form of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO).
•   This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.

Paddy Fields contribute in Global warming. We should know that Paddy fields full of rice are among the world's biggest producers of methane, contributing around 10%
of global emissions.

•   Methane, a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is produced by bacteria in the soil.

•   Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, responsible for about 20% of global warming. Rice absorbs carbon from the atmosphere, but if the plant cannot utilize it efficiently, the carbon is dispersed into the soil from the roots of the rice plants. Methane is produced from carbon and hydrogen by bacteria in the soil.
•   New varities of rice are being developed which channel carbon into making flowers  and  grain  put  less  of  it  into  the  soil.  Further,  production  of methane  can be significantly reduced through midseason drainage and alternate wetting and drying irrigation, without reducing the rice yield (as practiced in Japan).
•   Please also note that Livestock, and in particular ruminants are one of the important sources of methane emission on a global scale. There are two sources of methane emission from live stock viz. from digestive process of ruminants and from animal wastes.

•   Recycling of nutrients can be checked through harvest. Removing nitrogen and phosphorous at the source, division of nutrient-­‐‑rich waters from the receiving  bodies  and  dilution  of  these  elements  can  minimize Eutrophication.
•   Algal  blood  should  be  removed  upon  their  death  and  decomposition.

Limiting the dissolve nutrients can control algal growth. The most suitable, feasible and effective method involves the use of chemicals to precipitate additional phosphorus.
•   Precipitants  like  alum,  lime,  iron  and  sodium  aluminate  may  be  used.

Physicochemical methods can be adopted to remove nutrients. for example phosphorous can be removed by precipitation and nitrogen by nitrification or denitrification.
•   Electrodialysis,   reverse   osmosis   and   ion   exchange   methods.   Copper- sulphate and sodium arsenite are employed for killing algae and rooted planet respectively.

recent (since about 1975) ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33% of their pre-­‐‑

1975 values.

a)  The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December; as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container.
b)  In this container over 50% of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed.

c) Announcement of polar ozone depletion over Antarctica in March 1985 prompted scientific initiatives to discover the ozone depletion processes, along with calls to freeze or diminish production of chlorinated fluorocarbons.
d)  A complex scenario of atmospheric dynamics, solar radiation, and chemical reactions was found to explain the anomalously low levels of ozone during the polar springtime.
e)  Recent expeditions to the arctic regions show that similar processes can occur in the northern hemisphere, but o a somewhat lesser degree due to warmer temperatures and erratic dynamics patterns. However, this ozone layer has been destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons and other factors, creating an ozone hole nearly twice the size of Antarctica in 1998.
f)   Every  summer  (December  to  January)  the  hole  repairs  itself  when

stratospheric temperatures rise and the air above Antarctica mixes with the rest of the world's atmosphere. This cycle of ozone hole formation and reparation is repeated every year.
g)  The ozone hole over Antarctica has been forming every year since the early

1970s. In recent years the hole has become both larger and deeper, in the sense that more and more ozone is being destroyed.
h)  Every March to April during the Northern Hemisphere springtime similar, but less pronounced ozone hole forms above the Arctic.
i)   The natural circulation of wind -­‐‑     the polar vortex -­‐‑     which isolates Antarctica from the rest of the world during the Southern Hemisphere winter and early spring, contributing to the ozone loss there, is much less developed in the Northern Hemisphere above the Arctic.
j)   In addition, stratospheric temperatures at Arctic, are not as low as in the Antarctic, and consequently the loss of ozone is not as severe. However, the formation of even a moderate ozone hole above the Arctic region can give cause for considerable concern due to the greater populations in the higher
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

57.Solution: a)

Analysis of soils of tropical regions shows them to be virtually devoid of soluble minerals. Rocks weather rapidly due to high temperatures and abundant moisture, and millennia of rapid weathering and torrential rains to wash away nutrients from the soils have left the soils very low in nutrient stocks.

This is supported by the analysis of stream water draining tropical regions, which likewise reveals a scarcity of dissolved nutrients. Most tropical soils are clays with little soluble mineral content, and moderate to strong acidity which interferes with the ability of roots to take up nutrients. Only about 20% of the humid tropics has soils that can support agriculture, and most of this area is already in use.

The term gamma diversity (γ-diversity) was introduced by R. H. Whittaker together with the terms alpha diversity (α-diversity) and beta diversity (β-diversity). Whittaker's idea was that the total species diversity in a landscape (γ) is determined by two different things, the mean species diversity in sites or habitats at a more local scale (α) and the differentiation among those habitats (β). According to this reasoning, alpha diversity and beta diversity constitute independent components of
gamma diversity:

Explanation: A pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) is a nuclear power reactor, commonly using unenriched natural uranium as its fuel, that uses heavy water (deuterium oxide D2O) as its coolant and moderator. The heavy water coolant is kept under pressure, allowing it to be heated to higher temperatures without boiling,
much as in a typical pressurized water reactor. While heavy water is significantly
more expensive than ordinary light water, it yields greatly enhanced neutron economy, allowing the reactor to operate without fuel enrichment facilities (mitigating the additional capital cost of the heavy water) and generally enhancing the ability of the reactor to efficiently make use of alternate fuel cycles.

All the nuclear reactor units of Rajasthan, Kaiga, Kakrapar, Madras and Narora are based on PHWRs. Two of the four units of Tarapur are also based on PHWRs. Also India is ready to sell Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors of 220 MWe or 540 MWe capacity to other countries. These reactors, which use natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as both moderator and coolant, offered a basket of options for countries looking for cost-competitive and proven technologies in the small- and medium- sized reactors.

Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme:

ICDS was launched in 1975 in accordance to the National Policy for Children in India. The scheme aims at holistic development of under-six children and providing nutritional and health support to pregnant and lactating mothers. Scheme provides for a package of six services viz. supplementary nutrition, immunization, referral services, health check-up, pre-school non formal education and health and nutrition education. Three of the six services namely Immunization, Health Check-up and Referral Services are delivered through Public Health system.

•   These services are provided from Anganwadi centres established mainly in rural areas and staffed with frontline workers.
•   In addition to fighting malnutrition and ill health, the programme is also intended to combat gender inequality by providing girls the same resources as boys.

The scheme is implemented through the States/UTs on a cost sharing basis in the ratio of 50:50 for supplementary nutrition (SNP) and 90:10 for other components except in the case of North Eastern States where the share of Central and State Government is in the ratio of 90:10 for all the components including SNP.

The predefined objectives of ICDS are:

•   To raise the health and nutritional level of poor Indian children below 6 years of age.
•   To create a base for proper mental, physical and social development of children in India.
•   To reduce instances of mortality, malnutrition and school dropouts among
Indian children.
•   To coordinate activities of policy formulation and implementation among all departments of various ministries involved in the different government programmes and schemes aimed at child development across India.

Almost all parts of the Constitution, including the Preamble and amending clause, were changed by the 42nd Amendment, and some new articles and sections were inserted. The amendment's fifty-nine clauses stripped the Supreme Court of many of its powers and moved the political system toward parliamentary sovereignty. It curtailed democratic rights in the country, and gave sweeping powers to the Prime Minister's Office. The amendment gave Parliament unrestrained power to amend any parts of the Constitution, without judicial review. It transferred more power from the state governments to the central government, eroding India's federal structure. The
42nd Amendment also amended the Preamble and changed the description of India
from "sovereign democratic republic" to a "sovereign, socialist secular democratic republic", and also changed the words "unity of the nation" to "unity and integrity of the nation".

Major Amendments made in the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act are:

•   Preamble: The characterization of India as ‘Sovereign Democratic Republic’ has been changed to ‘Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic’. The words ‘Unity of the nation’ have been changed to ‘Unity and integrity of the nation'.
•   Legislatures: The life of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies was extended from 5 to 6 years.
•   Executive: It amended Article 74 to state explicitly that the President shall act in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers in discharge of his duty.
•   Judiciary: The 42nd Amendment Act inserted Article 32A in order to deny the Supreme Court the power to consider the Constitutional validity of a State law. Another new provision. Article 131A, gave the Supreme Court and exclusive jurisdiction to determine question relating to the Constitutional validity of a central law.
•   Under Article 144A the minimum number of judges of the Supreme Court to decide a question of a Constitutional validity of a central or State law was fixed as at least seven and further, this required two-two-thirds majority of the judges sitting declare law as unconstitutional. While the power of the High Court enforce fundamental rights remained untouched, several restrictions were imposed on its power to issue writs ‘for any other purpose’.
•   Federalism: The Act added Article 257A in the Constitution to enable the Centre to deploy any armed force of the union, or any other force under its control. For dealing with any grave situation of law and order in any State.
•   Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles: A major change that was made by 42nd Constitutional Amendment was to give primacy to all directive principles over the fundamental right contained in Articles 14, 19 or 31. the
42nd Constitutional Amendment added a few more directive principles free

•   Fundamental Duties: The 42nd Amendment Act inserted Article 51-A to create a new part called IV-A in the Constitution, which prescribed the fundamental duties to the citizens.
•   Emergency: Prior to 42nd Amendment Act, the President could declare emergency under Article 352 throughout the country and not in a part of the country alone. The Act authorised the President to proclaim emergency in any part of the country.
•   The amendment inserted a new article 228A in the Constitution which gave High Courts the authority to "determine all questions as to the constitutional validity of any State law".
•   This Act amended Article 74 and it was explicitly stipulated that "the
President shall act in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers".
•   This Amendment gave primacy to the Directive Principles, by stating that "no law implementing any of the Directive Principles could be declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated any of the Fundamental Rights".

National Science Day (NSD) is celebrated every year on 28th February to mark the discovery of the ‘Raman Effect’, for which a Nobel Prize winning research paper submitted by Sir C.V. Raman was accepted on that day.

What is Raman Effect?

•   Raman Effect is a phenomenon in spectroscopy discovered by the eminent physicist C.V. Raman.
•   Raman Effect, change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. When a beam of light traverses a dust-free, transparent sample of a chemical compound, a small fraction of the light emerges in directions other than that of the incident (incoming) beam. Most
of this scattered light is of unchanged wavelength. A small part, however, has wavelengths different from that of the incident light; its presence is a result of the Raman Effect.
