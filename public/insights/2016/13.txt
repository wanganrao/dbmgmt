Answer: A
 Rights to all activities like hunting, grazing, etc. in reserved forests are banned unless specific orders are issued otherwise. In protected areas, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. So, 1 is correct.
Both can be declared by the state government. So, 2 is wrong.
Unclassed forests (not reserved or protected) are other forests and wastelands belonging to both government and private individuals and communities. So, 3 is also wrong.

3 Water absorption through roots can be increased by keeping the plants
a)  Covered with a plastic bag
b)  In LED light
c)  Under the fan
d)  In dark shade
Answer: C
  Transpiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere.
Increased movement of the air around a plant will result in a higher transpiration rate. This is somewhat related to the relative humidity of the air, in that as water transpires from a leaf, the water saturates the air surrounding the leaf.
If there is no wind, the air around the leaf may not move very much, raising the humidity of the air around the leaf.
Wind will move the air around, with the result that the more saturated air close to the leaf is replaced by drier air. So, (c) is correct.
If a plant is kept in conditions (a), (b) or (d), transpiration rate would not increase.

a)  Dudhwa National Park
b)  Valley of Flowers National Park
c)  Gangotri National Park
d)  Indravati National Park
Answer: B
 Dudhwa is in U.P, whereas Joshimath is in Uttarakhand. So, (a) is eliminated.
While Gangotri park is in Uttarakhand, Harsil is the nearest town and it is not in the
UNESCO network. So, (c) is also eliminated. Indravati is in MP, so (d) is also wrong.
 Located in West Himalayas, it is home to rare and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, musk deer, brown bear, red fox and blue sheep.
Flowers like orchids, poppies, primulas, marigold, daisies and anemones carpet the ground at the national park.

7 Prithvi-II developed by DRDO under India's prestigious Integrated Guided Missile Development Program is a surface-to-surface medium range ballistic missile. What do you understand by ballistic missiles?
a)  Most of the trajectory of these missiles is unpowered and governed by gravity and air resistance
b)  Missiles that are aerodynamically guided in a powered flight
c)  Missiles that spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere
d)  Missiles that are launched at a steep trajectory and can caused heavy damage to its target
Answer: A
 A ballistic missile is a missile (rocket) that follows a ballistic trajectory with the objective of delivering one or more warheads to a predetermined target.
A ballistic missile is only guided during relatively brief periods of flight (there are unguided ballistic missiles as well, although these may well be considered rockets), and most of its trajectory is unpowered and governed by gravity and air resistance if in the atmosphere.
This contrasts to a cruise missile, which is aerodynamically guided in powered flight.
Long range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) are launched at a steep, sub- orbital flight trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere. Shorter range ballistic missiles stay within the Earth's atmosphere.

11 Most of the explosions in mines happen due to the occurrence of?
a)  Methane and air
b)  Oxygen and acetylene
c)  Hydrogen and oxygen
d)  Carbon dioxide and methane
Answer: A
  Methane explosions occur in mines when a build-up of methane gas, a by-product of coal, comes into contact with a heat source, and there is not enough air to dilute the gas to levels below its explosion point.
This produces water, carbon dioxide and a lot of amount of heat.
The heat generated by this process raises the temperature of the air within the mine, which causes it to expand in volume. Since hot air cannot expand easily underground, pressure builds in the mine. If this pressure is high enough, it can cause the air ahead of the combustion zone to compress and cause a shock wave,

17 Why loosening of soil is important for agriculture?
1.  It allows the roots to breathe easily.
2.  The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only

d)  None
Answer: C
 Loose soil has more air trapped in it than tight soil. Roots get more oxygen and loose space this way and grow properly. So, 1 is correct.
Tight soil prohibits the growth of microbes as well as their movement. Loosening of soil allows for microbe action which decomposes organic matter to form humus in the soil. So, 2 is correct.
 Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that
plants can use these nutrients.

26 What do you understand by the term 'Inflation tax'?
a)  Inflation caused by deficit financing which erodes peoples' income thus acting as a tax.
b)  Low tax rates set by the government leading to high consumption and inflation
c)  Taxation policy that changes with the rate of inflation in the economy
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
 Inflation tax is not an actual legal tax paid to a government; instead "inflation tax" refers to the penalty for holding cash at a time of high inflation. When the government prints more money or reduces interest rates, it floods the market with cash, which raises inflation in the long run. If an investor is holding securities, real estate or other assets, the effect of inflation may be negligible. If a
person is holding cash, though, this cash is worth less after inflation has risen.
The degree of decrease in the value of cash is termed the inflation tax for the way it punishes people who hold assets in cash, which tend to be lower- and middle-class wage earners.
It is noteworthy that even deficit financing can act as a tax on people which actually was intended to boost demand in the economy.

Answer: D
 The Chola Empire was divided into mandalams and each mandalam into valanadus and nadus. In each nadu there were a number of autonomous villages.
A village was divided into thirty wards and each was to nominate its members to the village council.
The qualifications to become a ward member were: Ownership of at least one fourth veli of land.

a)  Partition of India
b)  Reform of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies
c)  Three language formula
d)  Reorganization of states on linguistic basis
Answer: A
 It was a proposal formulated by Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari to solve the political deadlock between the All India Muslim League and Indian National Congress on independence of India from the British.
The League's position was that the Muslims and Hindus of British India were of two separate nations and hence the Muslims had the right to their own nation when India obtained independence.
He devised a proposal for the Congress to offer the League the Muslim Pakistan based on plebiscite of all the people in the regions where Muslims made a majority.
Although the formula was opposed even within the Congress party, Gandhi used it as his proposal in his talks with Jinnah in 1944. However, Jinnah rejected the proposal and the talks failed.

3.  Wood obtained from the tree is stronger than steel.
4.  Oil and residue of the plant are very healthy and are generally consumed naturally without processing.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4 only
Answer: C
 Statement 1: It is naturally distributed in tropical and temperate Asia, from India to Japan to Thailand to Malesia to north and north-eastern Australia to some Pacific islands.
Statement 2: It has been propagated and distributed further around the world in humid and subtropical environments from sea-level to 1200m, although in the Himalayan foothills it is not found above 600m.
Withstanding temperatures slightly below 0 'C and up to about 50 'C and annual rainfall of 50'2,50 cm, the tree grows wild on sandy and rocky soils, including
oolitic limestone, and will grow in most soil types, even with its roots in salt water.
Statement 3: The wood is said to be beautifully grained but splits easily when sawn thus relegating it to firewood, posts, and tool handles.
Statement 4: While the oil and residue of the plant are toxic and will induce nausea and vomiting if ingested, the fruits and sprouts, along with the seeds, are used in many traditional remedies.

37 The Brundtland Commission Report 1987 is related to
a)  Organized Crime
b)  Nuclear Proliferation
c)  Sustainable d)  International Arm Trade
Answer: C
 Brundtland Report also known as 'Our Common Future' came from the
United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED).
The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial
to formulating strategies for environmental conservation.
It also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed.

38 A person with zero income may not be able to avail drinking water in a society based on which of these economic systems?
a)  Socialistic model
b)  Capitalistic model
c)  Mixed economic model
d)  Communist model
Answer: B
 In extreme capitalism, markets are left free without regulation. Only those who have the ability to pay can enjoy goods or services.
In such a society, drinking water will also be commodified and sold in the market based on the forces of supply and demand. If a person has zero income, he will not be able to purchase drinking water.
However, this is a hypothetical case, and today many capitalist societies have some or the other form of fundamental social security measures for basic health, water, sanitation and education.

39 Which of the following practice(s) help stop soil erosion?
1.  Mulching
2.  Mixed farming
3.  Crop rotation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Mulching is when the bare ground between plants is covered with a layer of organic matter like straw. It helps to retain soil moisture, protects the soil from erosion and reduces compaction from the impact of heavy rains thus stopping soil erosion.
Statement 2: Combining crops and livestock also has the potential to maintain ecosystem function and health and help prevent agricultural systems from becoming too brittle, or over connected, by promoting greater biodiversity, and therefore increased capability to absorb shocks to the natural resource base
Statement 3: Crop rotation allows conservation and rejuvenation of the nutrient base of soil.

40 Why the Tamil Nadu coast remains dry during the South-west monsoon season?
1.  It is located in the Southern most end of India.
2.  It is situated parallel to the Bay of Bengal branch of southwest monsoon.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Since the monsoon winds blow parallel to the coasts, they do not cause precipitation or rain. So, 2 is correct.
The TN coasts also lie in the rainshadow area of the Arabian Sea branch of the south-west Monsoon. Thus, they remain largely dry during the summer monsoon.
Even Kerala is located in the southern most end but receives a good amount of rainfall in the summer monsoon. So, 1 is incorrect.

46 Ganges shark is critically endangered because
1.  They need to migrate to salt water to reproduce offsprings.
2.  They are misinterpreted as large catfish and killed as they damage local ecosystem.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
Statement 1: It is bull sharks that migrate to salt water to reproduce, not Ganges shark. Ganges shark is found in a very narrow range of habitat. So, 1 is wrong.
However, construction of dams and barrages have affected their migratory patterns and threatened their life cycles.
Statement 2: It is wrong. They are misterpreted for bull sharks. Catfishes look very different from this shark. Overfishing, habitat degradation from pollution, increasing river use and management, local killing for meat, gillnet and oil etc are reasons for their population decline.

47 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): The storage life of a fresh fruit is influenced by its respiratory activity.
2.  Reason(R): Metabolic activity in fresh fruits continues for a short period even after harvest.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R cannot be an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
 Respiration is the chemical process by which fruits and vegetables convert sugars and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water, and heat. Metabolic activity in fresh fruits and vegetables continues for a short period after harvest.
The energy required to sustain this activity comes from the respiration process. Respiration involves the oxidation of sugars to produce carbon dioxide, water and
heat. The storage life of a commodity is influenced by its respiratory activity.
By storing a commodity at low temperature, respiration is reduced and senescence is
delayed, thus extending storage life.

48 Consider the following statements.
1.  When the moon's orbit is closest to the earth, tidal range is lower than normal.
2.  When the earth is closest to the Sun tidal range is greater than normal.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
Tidal range is affected by the gravitational forces of the Sun and
Moon. The closer they are to earth, higher is the tidal range.
When earth is closest to both Sun and Moon, unusually high tides occur. It also occurs when earth is closest to any one of these.

49 If RBI wishes to increase money supply in Indian economy, it would
1.  Decrease Reverse repo rate
2.  Increase Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
3.  Issue orders to public to keep all private financial savings in bank accounts
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: D
Statement 1: Reverse repo rate is basically the rate that banks get for parking their funds with the RBI. Reducing this rate makes the bank park their
money somewhere else and not with RBI. For it is less attractive to them. Money
parked outside RBI circulated by the banks would become a part of the money supply.
Statement 2: Increasing CRR sucks liquidity from the banking system and increases the idle deposits of banks with RBI.
Statement 3: Banking deposits and the money held by the public form a part of the money supply. Even if a customer deposits money in bank, it will not change the total money supply, but only its liquidity.

50 Consider the following statements about rock formation.
1.  Magnetically susceptible minerals get aligned to the earth's magnetic field during the period of rock formation.
2.  Foliated metamorphic rocks are formed within the Earth's interior under extremely high pressures that are unequal in different directions.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: This comes due to geomagnetism. Magnetic response of rocks is determined by amounts and susceptibilities of constituent minerals. Sedimentary rocks have very low susceptibility to magnetic field of earth. So, there is little alignment in their constituents in response to earth's magnetic field. For ultramafic rocks it is the highest.
Statement 2: Foliation refers to repetitive layering in metamorphic rocks.
When the pressure is greater in one direction than in the others (directed pressure), it causes the minerals in the original rock to reorient themselves with the long and flat minerals aligning perpendicular to the grea

51 Katabatic winds occur due to
a)  Density differences in wind at different altitudes
b)  Differential warming of the ocean surface near coasts
c)  Local thunderstorms guided by high convection rates
d)  Seasonal land breeze in the interior of continents
Answer: A
 These are downslope winds flowing from high elevations of mountains, plateaus, and hills down their slopes to the valleys or planes below.
A katabatic wind originates from radiational cooling of air atop a plateau, a mountain, glacier, or even a hill.
Since the density of air is inversely proportional to temperature, the air will flow downwards, warming approximately adiabatically as it descends.
The temperature of the air depends on the temperature in the source region and the amount of descent.

52 High sulphur dioxide in air has which of the following harmful effects?
1.  It can cause irritation to the eyes resulting in tears and redness.
2.  Its high concentration leads to stiffness of flower buds and their falling off from plants.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
  Sulphur dioxide irritates the skin and mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. So, 1 is correct.
High concentrations of SO2 can cause inflammation and irritation of the respiratory system, particularly during heavy physical activity. The resulting symptoms may
include pain when taking a deep breath, coughing, throat irritation, and breathing difficulties.

53 Lead can be found in
1.  Paints
2.  Batteries
3.  Some colours of Ink
4.  Exhaust emissions
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1, 3 and 4 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
 Lead was used in paint to add colour, improve the ability of the paint to hide the surface it covers, and to make it last longer.
Lead seldom occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes. Lead enters drinking water primarily as a result of the corrosion, or wearing away, of materials containing lead in the water distribution system and household or building plumbing

54 Rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world because
a)  Oceans receive larger solar insolation per unit area than land
b)  Ocean water is salty.
c)  Oceans are huge sources of water as compared to land.
d)  Frequent cyclones occur over the oceans as compared to land.
Answer: C
 Option (a): Oceans receive lesser solar insolation per unit area due to the cloudiness over them. Clouds reflect back solar insolation.
Option (d): Cyclones occur due to intense evaporation and existence of low pressure zone. They are one of the phenomena associated with high rainfall on oceans, not its cause.
Since there is more water in oceans and wind movement is unable to carry all cloudiness to land, rainfall is greater in oceans.

55 Consider the following statements about the legislative process in the states.
1.  The status of legislative councils in passing ordinary bills is weaker than Rajya
Sabha.
2.  There is no provision of joint sitting in case of a disagreement between the two houses in the states.
3.  If the Governor accepts the changes made by the legislative council which were not accepted by the assembly, then the bill is deemed to be passed.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 The Governor cannot accept a bill which has not been passed by the assembly. Doing so would be unconstitutional. So, 3 is incorrect.
Joint sitting provision is not there, because the assembly has overriding powers with respect to passing any bill in the state. So, the Council is much weaker than the assembly. Thus, 1 and 2 are correct.

56 The early atmosphere on earth in the course of its evolution largely contained
a)  Water vapour, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and very little of free oxygen
b)  Abundant oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia
c)  Carbon dioxide, methane and very little of free ammonia and nitrogen
d)  Sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour and very little of free
ammonia Answer: A
 During the cooling of the earth, gases and water vapour were released from the interior solid earth.
This started the evolution of the present atmosphere. The early atmosphere largely contained water vapour, nitrogen carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and very little of free oxygen.
The process through which the gases were outpoured from the interior is called degassing. Continuous volcanic eruptions contributed water vapour and gases.

57 Consider the following statements.

Kankwadi fort.
The above refer to?
a)  Sariska Tiger Reserve
b)  Simlipal National Park
c)  Jim Corbett National Park
d)  Ranthambore National Park
Answer: A
 It is located in the Alwar district of the state of Rajasthan.
The area of Sariska, being a part of the Aravalli Range, is rich in mineral resources, such as copper. In spite of the Supreme Court's 1991 ban on mining in the area, marble mining continues to threaten the environment.
The dominant tree in the forests is dhok.
Pandupol in the hills in the centre of the reserve is believed to be one of the retreats of Pandavas.

3.  Fishes
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
  Statement 1: Dragonflies, beetles, butterflies and moths are common insect migrants. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from bird migration.
Statement 2: Gazelles, Zebra, Whales, Dolphin are some common mammal migrants. Mass migration occurs in mammals with a kind of annual circular pattern of movement in many cases.
Statement 3: Most fish species are relatively limited in their movements, remaining in a single geographical area and making short migrations for wintering, to spawn, or to feed. A few hundred species migrate long distances, in some cases of thousands of kilometres. About 120 species of fish, including several species of salmon, migrate between saltwater and freshwater.

59 At the international level, Geographical Indication (GI) tag is governed by the
a)  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
b)  Agreement on Trans-national Resources (AOTNR)
c)  International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
d)  World Heritage List, UNESCO
Answer: A
 Geographical Indication (GI) Geographical Indication is an insignia on products having a unique geographical origin and evolution over centuries with regards to its special quality or reputation attributes.
It is a mark of authenticity and ensures that registered authorised users (or at least those residing inside the geographic territory) are allowed to use the popular product name, e.g. Hyderabadi Biryani.
At international level, GI is governed by World Trade Organisation's
(WTO's) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS).
TRIPS requires WTO members to provide copyright rights, covering content producers including performers, producers of sound recordings and broadcasting organizations; geographical indications, including appellations of origin; industrial designs; integrated circuit layout-designs; patents; new plant varieties; trademarks etc.
In India, GI registration is governed by the Geographical Indications of goods
(Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. Darjeeling tea was the first product in India accorded with GI tag.

60 Weak muscles and feeling very little energy to work is a symptom of the deficiency of
a)  Vitamin A
b)  Iodine
c)  Vitamin B1
d)  Vitamin K
Answer: C
 Vitamin A deficiency can cause vision related problems, even loss of vision sometimes. So, (a) is incorrect.
Iodine deficieny causes goitre and mental disability in children. So, (b) is incorrect. Vitamin B1, also called as Thiamine, deficiency may lead to chronic diseases such
as Beriberi which is a neurological and cardiovascular disease. Muscle weakness and energy deficit in body etc are other symptoms associated with its deficiency.
Very small amounts of vitamin B1 are found in virtually all foods.

The PM heads the appointments committee of the Cabinet. There is no appointments committee in the Lok Sabha. So, 3 is wrong.

62 What do you understand by the term 'Hidden Hunger'?
a)  Deficiency of micronutrients, proteins and vitamins despite getting a calorie rich diet
b)  Percentage of hungry people that go unaccounted in official surveys
c)  A phenomenon that exists in social classes that are economically well off but lack in nutrition and health related aspects
d)  Malnourishment of foetus during pregnancy of weak and malnourished
mothers
Answer: A
 More than 840 million people in the world do not have adequate food to meet their daily food and nutritional requirements.
A far greater number' three billion people ' suffer from micronutrient, protein and vitamin deficiencies or 'hidden hunger' because they cannot afford to buy enough fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and meat.
Diets lacking essential micronutrients ' particularly iron, vitamin A, iodine and zinc ' increase the risk for disease, reduce lifespan and reduce mental abilities.

63 Which of the following can be the reason(s) for greater biological productivity at the tropics as compared to the higher latitudes?
a)  Higher solar energy is available at tropics
b)  Less extreme seasonal variation as compared to the higher latitudes
c)  Remained undisturbed for longer durations than higher latitudes
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Option (a): There is more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to higher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater diversity.
Option (b): Tropical environments, unlike temperate ones, are less seasonal, relatively more constant and predictable. Such constant environments promote niche specialisation and lead to a greater species diversity and
Option (c): Speciation is generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected to frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long evolutionary time for species diversification.

67 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): The Governor exercises more discretion that the President does in their respective spheres of influences.
2.  Reason (R): The constitutional provisions explicitly limit the overall discretion of the President, which is not so clearly defined for the Governor.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
 Article 74(1) clearly prescribes that the President is bound by the advice of the council of Ministers. However, in the case of Governor, the respective provision does not make the advice of the council of ministers in state binding on him.
Article 163 is clear in this regard:
There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his function, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.
If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.

70 Under WTO's provision of 'aggregate measure of support', which of the following
would qualify?
1.  Subsidies on Irrigation
2.  Subsidies on Power
3.  Credit subsidies
4.  Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  1, 2 and 3 only
c)  4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4 only
Answer: D
 WTO agreement envisages two kinds of support to agriculture, viz. domestic support and export subsidies.
The domestic support is further classified into five categories: (a) aggregate measure of support (AMS) which includes product specific and non-product specific support (b) green box support (c) blue box support (d) de minimus support and (e) special and differential (S&D) treatment box.
Out of these, WTO agreement requires reduction only in AMS and export subsidies, whereas, support under all other heads is exempted.
AMS includes (a) sum total of subsidies on inputs like fertiliser, water, credit, power etc and (b) market price support measured by calculating the difference between domestic administered market price and external reference price (world price) multiplied by quantity of production eligible to get applied administered price.

71 Cripps mission was sent to India to
a)  Discuss the modalities of partition of India
b)  Negotiate Indian National Congress' (INC) stand in the Round Table
Conferences
c)  Address the issue of war crimes and extra-judicial killings by the British
d)  Secure full Indian cooperation and support for British efforts in World War
II.
Answer: D
Background:The British feared that the destabilizing of India might encourage a Japanese invasion, and would reduce the number of men who volunteered to fight the war.
Japan in 1942 had overrun Malaya and was into Burma; the threat of an invasion of
India was real.
British wanted the cooperation and support of Indian political leaders in order to recruit more Indians into the British Indian Army, which was fighting in the Middle East theatre.
Mission:
The war cabinet of Britain sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India in 1942 to elicit cooperation from the Indians.
It promised for the fulfillment of past promises to self government to Indian people.
The proposal of the Cripps mission was that: "India would be a dominion associated with the United kingdom".
It promised that immediately after the war is stopped, steps would be taken up to set up an elected body charged with the task of making the constitution for India and provisions would be made so that the Indian states could participate in the framing of the constitution.

72 In the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the vote of each country is weighed by its
a)  Money contribution to the IMF
b)  Size of GDP
c)  Diplomatic and military might
d)  An index weighting all of (a), (b) and (c)
Answer: A
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) is one of the biggest moneylenders for any country in the world.
Its 188 member states (as in 2012) do not have equal voting rights. The vote of each country is weighed by how much money it has contributed to the IMF.
Majority of the voting power in the IMF is in the hands of only ten countries (US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Russia). The remaining 178 countries have very little say in how these international organisations take decisions. The World Bank has a similar system of voting.

73 Consider the following about Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).
1.  They have been established by an Act of Parliament.
2.  It does not receive any grant or support from the government and is sponsored by a parent commercial bank.
3.  RRBs operate in all districts in India.
4.  RRBs are allowed to mobilize deposits only from rural areas.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: C
Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were established in 1975 under the provisions of an Ordinance and followed by Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976. So, 1 is correct.
It was done with a view to develop the rural economy and to create a supplementary channel to the 'Cooperative Credit Structure' with a view to enlarge institutional credit for the rural and agriculture sector.
The Government of India, the concerned State Government and the bank, which had sponsored the RRB contributed to the share capital of RRBs in the proportion of
50%, 15% and 35%, respectively. So, 2 is incorrect.
The area of operation of the RRBs is limited to notified few districts in a State. So, 3 is also incorrect.
The RRBs mobilise deposits primarily from rural/semi-urban areas and provide
loans and advances mostly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, rural artisans and other segments of priority sector. So, 4 is incorrect too.

74 Consider the following statements in relation to the Article 371-A of the constitution making special provisions for Nagaland.
1.  The Nagaland state assembly can declare that a law made by the Parliament is not applicable to it on religious and social grounds.

Naga customary law,
ownership and transfer of land and its resources,
shall apply to the State of Nagaland unless the Legislative Assembly of Nagaland by a resolution so decides.

75 Consider the following statements.
1.  Tropical cyclones originate only over the seas.
2.  In the tropical latitudes, tropical cyclones generally move from east to west.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
The tropical cyclones originate only over the seas and they dissipate on reaching the land. It is because they are supported by the moisture from the sea. So, 1 is correct.
On the equatorward side of the subtropical ridge, general easterly winds prevail. Also, there is an axis of high pressure called the subtropical ridge that extends east- west poleward of the storm. They steer the tropical cyclones to the west from the east. So, 2 is correct.

76 India is the world's largest arms importer. Which two countries follow immediately in the ranking of total arms imports?
1.  China
2.  Australia
3.  Ukraine
4.  Myanmar
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2
b)  2 and 3
c)  1 and 4
d)  2 and 4
Answer: A
Top arms importers are: India (14%), China (4.7%), Australia (3.6%), Pakistan (3.3%), Vietnam (2.9%) and South Korea (2.6%).
India's arms imports remain three times greater than those of its rivals Pakistan and China. Its biggest suppliers are Russia, United States (US), Israel and France.
This indicates India's failure to build a strong domestic defence-industrial
base (DIB) and Indian arms industry has failed to produce competitive
indigenously-designed weapons.
Earlier China used to be top on the imports chart but in past few decades it has gradually built a stronger DIB. China has emerged as the world's third largest arms exporter after United States and Russia.

77 The passing of Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2016 in the Parliament would
a)  Clarify provisions of the criminal justice system in case of convicted MPs and MLAs
b)  Give voting rights to people who became Indian citizens following the exchange of enclaves between India and Bangladesh
c)  Enlarge the powers of Election Commission to investigate paid news and fake accounts submitted by political parties
d)  None of the above
Answer: B
 The historic land boundary agreement signed between India and Bangladesh had altered the geography and demography of the district of Cooch Behar in West Bengal.
Under this agreement, 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (Chhitmahals) were added in the
Indian Territory and 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh territory.
Since the newly acquired area has become the part of Indian territory, it was necessary to make delimitation exercise within the limited constituency area of Cooch Behar before the ensuing 2016 West Bengal State Assembly elections.

b)  1 and 2 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
 Central economic planning started with the setting up of the National
Planning Committee (1938). So, 3 is wrong.
Foreign investment was discouraged because of the colonial experience of Drain of wealth and the stagnant performance of the economy under the colonial rule. It grew by zero % between 1600 and 1870, and a meagre 0.2 % between 1870 to 1947.
So, 1 and 2 are correct.

86 Consider the following statements about the source of capital for the states in India.
1.  Finance commission does not generally determine capital related issues of the state and is confined to revenue matters and grants-in-aid only.
2.  The FRBM Act has restricted the freedom of the states to borrow for fulfilling their plan expenditure.
Which of the above is/are true?
a)  1 Only
b)  2 Only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Statement 1: Although the constitution does not define revenue and capita related matters, the job of finance commission is restricted. The capital
related issues of the states are taken care of by the Planning Commission which is
seen to eclipse the role of a constitutional body FC.
Statement 2: The FRBM Act does restrict the fiscal deficit of states by giving them a direction. But, it gives them further freedom to borrow from the markets in case they have enacted their own fiscal responsibility legislations. They can thus fulfill their plan expenditure. So, 2 is wrong.

87 What was/were the change(s) introduced in the Indian governance by the Government of India Act 1858?

The Company's territories in India were to be vested in the Queen, the Company ceasing to exercise its power and control over these territories. India was to be governed in the Queen's name. So, 1 is correct.
The administration of the country was now highly centralized. All civil, military and executive powers vested in the Governor in council, who in turn was responsible to Secretary of State. So, both 2 and 3 are incorrect.
There was also a provision of creation of an Indian Civil Service under the control of the Secretary of State.
This act abolished the Dual Government (Board of Control and Board of
Directors in the company) introduced by the Pitt's India act.

88 Agricultural produce market committees (APMC) are established by the
a)  Authorized Local area Vendors (ALAVs)
b)  Farmer Produce Organizations (FPOs)
c)  State Government
d)  Local Government
Answer: C
APMC operate on two principles:
Ensure that farmers are not exploited by intermediaries (and money lenders) who compel farmers to sell their produce at the farm gate for an extremely low price.
All food produce should first be brought to a market yard and then sold through auction.
Each state which operates APMC markets geographically divide the state and markets (mandis) are established at different places within the state.
Farmers are required to sell their produce via auction at the mandi in their region. Traders require a license to operate within a mandi.
Wholesale and retail traders (e.g. shopping mall owners) and food processing companies cannot buy produce directly from a farmer.

90 Which of the following CANNOT be the reason(s) for the downfall of the Hindu
Empires in India to the incoming Muslim rulers?
1.  The Hindu states were tied under a common federation thus devoid of exercising power.
2.  Their military methods were out of date and inferior to those of Muslims.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
  The most important cause for the downfall of Hindu states was that they lacked unity. There was no formal coordination mechanism. They were divided by factions. For e.g. the Rajput princes exhausted one another by their mutual conflicts. So, 1 cannot be the reason.
Also, many Hindu states were declining in power. Their military methods were out of date and far inferior to those of Muslims. Indians continued to rely on elephants while the Muslims possessed quick-moving cavalry. So, 2 can be a reason.
Other reasons can be:
The Muslims soldiers had better organization and able leaders.
Their religious zeal and their greed for the greater wealth of India provided stimulus to them.
Among the Hindus, the duty of fighting was confined to a particular class, the
Kshatriyas.
Moreover, the Hindus were always on the defensive, which was considered to be a weak position in war affairs then.

Answer: C
 Decisions that are vetoed by the P-5 cannot be submitted for the review of the UNGA. Also, the UNSC is the authority under the UN charter to take action in situations
threatening international peace and security, e.g. Syria crisis. So, 2 is incorrect. Decisions taken under Chapter VII, such as economic sanctions or other sections
like international security, are binding on UN members; the Security Council is the
only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions. The UNGA can only make recommendations in this regard. So, 1 is correct.
