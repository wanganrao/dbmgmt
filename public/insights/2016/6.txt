1 The theory of "continental drift" rests on which of the following assumptions?
1.  All the continents of the earth formed a single continental mass.
2.  Oceans existed in form of huge undercurrents as slowly advancing groundwater.
3.  Tilt of the earth was such that no coriolis force acted upon the wind system present on earth.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: B
According to Wegener, the proponent of continental drift, all the continents formed a single continental mass, a mega ocean surrounded by the same. The super continent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth.
The mega-ocean was called PANTHALASSA, meaning all water. So, statement 1 is correct, and 2 is incorrect.
Statement 3 is absurd. Coriolis force had existed ever since earth started rotating.
He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the super continent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today.

2 Consider the following with reference to the visit of Yuan Chwang (Hiuen Tsang) and his account of India.
1.  For the control of his extensive empire, Harsha relied upon his personal supervision rather than on services of a trained bureaucracy.
2.  Official records of public events were kept in every province by special officers.
3.  Imprisonment was not practiced as it was considered aninhumane punishment.
4.  Ordeals by water, fire and poison were instruments for the ascertainment of truth regarding an offence.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  1, 2 and 4 only
Answer: D
Hieun Tsang mentions, "Harsha relied upon his personal supervision exercised with untiring energy ratlier than upon the services of a trained bureaucracy. Except during the rainy season, when travelling with a huge camp was impracticable, he was incessantly on the move, punishing evil-doers and rewarding the meritorious." So, 1 is correct.
Official records of public events were kept in every province by special officers, whose duty it was to register "good and evil events, with calamities and fortunate occurrences." So, 2 is correct.
Imprisonment was the ordinary penalty, and it was of the cruel Tibetan type; the prisoners, "are simply left to live or die, and are not counted among men." So, 3 is also incorrect.
The other punishments were more sanguinary than in the Gupta period: mutilation
of the nose, ears, hands, or feet being inflicted as the penalty of serious offences, and even for failure in filial piety; but this penalty was sometimes commuted for banishment. Minor offences were visited with fines. Ordeals by water, fire, weighment, or poison were much esteemed as efficient instruments for the ascertainment of truth and are described with approval by the Chinese pilgrim. So, 4 is also correct.
The question in UPSC was probably framed from this source only http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson2/chapter13.htmlYou should go through it once.

3 Ethylene is highly effective in early ripening of fruits because
a)  It increase water uptake by plants during ripening process
b)  It increases the nutrient and carbohydrate content of the plant produce
c)  It promotes geotropism in plants that are near ripening thereby increasing solar energy intake
d)  It enhances the respiration rate in plants during ripening of the fruits.
Answer: D
Ethylene is a simple gaseous plant growth regulator (PGR). The concept of PGR has been covered in an earlier 
It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing ripening of fruits. It influences the horizontal growth of seedlings, breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers etc.
Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture.

4 What foods can be contaminated by Alfatoxins?
1.  Oilseeds
2.  Cereals
3.  Dried fruit and figs
4.  Chilli peppers
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
Aflatoxins are poisonous and cancer-causing chemicals that are produced by certain molds which grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains.
They are regularly found in improperly stored staple commodities such as cassava, chili peppers, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, and a variety of spices.
When contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals.
Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into eggs, milk products, and meat.

5 'Shadow zone' of an earthquake refers to the zone where
a)  Tendency of experiencing an earthquake is the maximum
b)  The destruction is highest due to the hypocentre being below the zone
c)  Earthquake waves reflect back due to the presence of large ocean beds
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Earthquake waves get recorded in seismographs located at far off locations. However, there exist some specific areas where the waves are not reported. Such a zone is called the 'shadow zone'.
It is due to the S wave. There are two types of body waves generated during an earthquake. They are called P and S-waves.
An important fact about S-waves is that they can travel only through solid materials. This characteristic of the S-waves is quite important as it has helped scientists to understand the structure of the interior of the earth. Hence, none of the above
options (a), (b) and (c) is correct.
You can see the image below or at the Q Source.

6 Aside from erosion control, 'Sea buckthorn" is valued for its
1.  Nutritious fruits
2.  High quality timber
3.  Medicinal value
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: C
The plant is primarily valued for its golden-orange fruits, which provide vitamin C, vitamin E, and other nutrients, flavonoids, oils rich in essential
fatty acids, and other healthful components. The leaves are now also being used for making a beverage tea. So, 1 is correct.
The flavonoids of sea buckthorn (mainly from fruit pulp; also in the leaves) and the oils of sea buckthorn (primarily in the seeds, but also in the fleshy part of the fruit) are the two items specially extracted for medicinal use. So, 3 is correct.

7 The source of magma in earth lies in
a)  Upper crust
b)  Mid-oceanic ridges
c)  Upper mantle
d)  Outer core of Earth
Answer: C
 The mantle contains a weaker zone called asthenosphere.
It is from this that the molten rock materials find their way to the surface. The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma.
Once it starts moving towards the crust or it reaches the surface, it is referred to as lava.
The material that reaches the ground includes lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dust and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon.

8 Which of the following is NOT supported by the "Big Bang" theory regarding the development of the Universe?
a)  All matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a "tiny ball"
b)  After temperatures dropped, the Universe became transparent.
c)  The expansion created by the "Big Bang" continues even to the present day.
d)  Immediately after the "Big Bang" all matter started rotating around a youthful
star generating dust, which we know as modern planets.
Answer: D
After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies. Hence, (d) is wrong.
The model accounts for the fact that the Universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state.
The Big Bang Theory considers the following stages in the development of the universe.
In the beginning, all matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a "tiny ball" (singular atom) with an unimaginably small volume, infinite temperature and infinite density.
At the Big Bang the "tiny ball" exploded violently. This led to a huge expansion. It is now generally accepted that the event of big bang took place
13.7 billion years before the present. The expansion continues even to the present day. As it grew, some energy was converted into matter.
Within 300,000 years from the Big Bang, temperature dropped to 4,500 K
and gave rise to atomic matter. The universe became transparent.

9 The term "pole fleeing force" relates to the
a)  Forces responsible for the bulging at the earth's poles
b)  Magnetic force as emitted through the poles aligning landforms on earth
c)  Outward directed forces associated with the spinning of Earth
d)  Forces that causes oscillations in the tilted axis of the earth
Answer: C
 It is a geophysical concept invoked in 1915 by Alfred
Wegener to explain his ideas of Continental drift.
He suggested that a differential gravitational force (horizontal component of centrifugal force) and the Earth's flattening would cause continental masses to drift
slowly towards the equator.
This force is caused due to the spinning of earth.
The hypothesis was expanded in 1920 but the force is now known to be far too weak to cause plate tectonics. The toughness of the sublayers of the Earth's crust is much stronger than assumed by Wegener.

10 Which of the following correctly points out the difference between the earthquakes witnessed in Alpine-Himalayan belts (AHB) and those in Mid-oceanic ridges (MOR)?
a)  In AHB most earthquakes are reservoir induced, whereas in MOR they are largely tectonic in origin.
b)  In MOR most earthquakes are caused due to reservoir convergence, whereas in AHB they result from frequent avalanches
c)  In AHB the foci of earthquake is deeper than that of the MOR earthquakes
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
 In general, the foci of the earthquake in the areas of mid- oceanic ridges are at shallow depths whereas along the Alpine-Himalayan belt as well as the rim of the Pacific, the earthquakes are deep-seated ones.
The reason for this is: In Mid-oceanic ridges, some of these earthquakes are caused by volcanic eruptions, and others are caused by breaking and ripping of the thin, newly created plate as it spreads to either side of the ridge.
But, in Alpine-Himalayan region heavy plate tectonics is at work, and causes massive deep-seated earthquakes.
Both regions come under the Ring of Fire.

11 Consider the following about Dhrupad, a genre in Hindustani classical music.
1.  It finds mention in Ain-e-Akbari.
2.  The phrases of Dhrupad alapa are slow and contemplative in the beginning, but the
tempo increases in stages.
3.  It is a sub-set of Khyal form of classical singing.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
Abul Fazl, courtier and chronicler at the court of the Emperor Akbar, defines the dhrupad verse form in his Ain-e-Akbari as "four rhyming lines, each of indefinite prosodic length. So, 1 is correct.
The elaboration of Dhrupad alap is done using the syllables of a mantric phrase, it is slow in the beginning and raises tempo after some time. So, 2 is correct.
Dhrupad and khy?l are the two forms of classical singing that exist today in North
India. So, 3 is wrong.

12 Which of the following about the tectonic 'Indian Plate' is NOT correct?
a)  It is a major tectonic plate.
b)  It forms a convergent late boundary with the Himalayas.
c)  The Indian plate is tectonically separated from the Peninsular India plate.
d)  The plate extends to Pakistan and Myanmar as well.
Answer: C
Plates are divided between major and minor plates based on their geographical coverage. Indian plate is thus a major plate. So, (a) is correct.
The subduction zone along the Himalayas forms the northern plate boundary in the form of continent- continent convergence. So, (b) is correct.
Peninsular plate is an integral part of the Indian plate. So, (c) is incorrect.
In the east, it extends through Rakinyoma Mountains of Myanmar towards the island
arc along the Java Trench. The Western margin follows Kirthar Mountain of
Pakistan. So, (d) is correct.

13 Use of leguminous green manure crop is preferred in comparison to non-legumes because
1.  The former adds more nitrogen to the soil.
2.  The latter does not provide organic matter to the soil.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Crops suitable for green manuring are divided into two groups:
Non-legumes or Non-leguminous crops: The non-legumes used as green manuring crops provide only organic matter to the soil. The non-legumes are used for green manuring to a limited extent.
Examples: Mustard, Wheat, Carrot, Jowar, Maize, Sunflower etc. Legumes or Leguminous Crops: The legumes used as green manuring crops provide nitrogen as well as organic matter to the soils. Legumes have the ability of acquiring nitrogen from the air with the help of its nodule bacteria. The legumes are most commonly used as green manuring crops.
Examples: Sannhemp, Djainach, Mung, Cowpea, Lentil, Senji, Berseem, Guar etc.
So, 1 is correct and 2 is incorrect.

14 Which of the following elements of earth's crust are more abundant than Iron?
a)  Aluminium and Copper
b)  Silicon and Manganese
c)  Oxygen and Aluminium
d)  Calcium and quartz
Answer: C
Quartz is the second most abundant mineral (not an element) in the
Earth's continental crust. So, option (d) can be eliminated.
You should also know that Silicon and Oxygen are two of the most abundant elements in earth's crust, and copper is not so abundant. So, (a) can be ruled out.
Out of all, if you remember that aluminium is an abundant material, you can go for option (c).
About 98 per cent of the total crust of the earth is composed of eight elements like oxygen, silicon, aluminium, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium, and the rest is constituted by titanium, hydrogen, phosphorous, manganese, sulphur, carbon, nickel and other elements.

15 Rotavirus vaccination project aims to tackle which of the following diseases?
a)  Malaria
b)  Hepatitis B
c)  Chikungunya
d)  Diarrhoea
Answer: D
Himachal Pradesh has become the first state in the country to start
Rotavirus vaccination project under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP).
The Rotavirus is the most common causative agent of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea
(MSD) among infants below 11 months age group in India.
The virus spreads from person to person due to bacterial and parasiting agents that are primarily transmitted through contaminated food or water.

16 Why is biological activity in rocks important?
1.  It helps expose the surface of rock to moisture and air
2.  Decaying plant and animal matter on rocks can enhance weathering of rocks.
3.  It can help in concentration of some minerals in the rocks.
4.  Plant roots can mechanically break the rocks.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
Statement 1: Burrowing and wedging by organisms like earthworms, termites, rodents etc., help in exposing the new surfaces to chemical attack and assists in the penetration of moisture and air.
Statement 2: Decaying plant and animal matter help in the production of humic, carbonic and other acids which enhance decay and solubility of some elements.
Statement 3: Algae utilise mineral nutrients for growth and help in concentration of iron and manganese oxides.
Statement 4: Plant roots exert a tremendous pressure on the earth materials mechanically breaking them apart.

17 Why are there more avalanches and landslides in Himalayas than Nilgiri Mountains?
1.  Nilgiris are made from divergent plate boundaries whereas Himalayas are not.
2.  There is greater amount of volcanic activity in Himalayas as compared to Nilgiris.
3.  Himalayas are tectonically active whereas Nilgiris are not very active.
4.  Nilgiris are made from unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, whereas Himalays are made from semi-consolidated deposits.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2 and 4 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
There are three reasons for greater avalanches in Himalays as compared to Nilgiris.
One, When speaking about tectonic activity, Himalayas are very active as they are young mountains. Nilgiris are relatively stable as they are old mountains.
Two, gradient is steep in Himalayas. Although it is steep in Nilgiris too, but at
Nilgiris rocks are hard.
Three, the rock deposits at Himalayas are still unconsolidated or semi-consolidated and weak.
Mechanical weathering due to temperature changes and range is pronounced in Nilgiris. They receive heavy amounts of rainfall over short periods. So, there is almost direct rock fall quite frequently in these places also along with landslides and debris avalanches.

18 Coriolis force plays a role in which of the following?
1.  Formation of meanders
2.  Direction of trade winds
3.  Directing Jet Streams
4.  Impact crater
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2 and 4 only
b)  3 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: C
Statement 1: Coriolis force acting on the fluid water deflecting it like it deflects the wind. This causes rivers to 'meander'.
Statement 2: It deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.
Statement 3: Jet streams typically cover long distances and can be thousands of miles long. They can be discontinuous and often meander across the atmosphere. The meanders in the jet stream flow slower than the rest of the air and are called Rossby Waves. They move slower because they are caused by the Coriolis Effect and turn west in respect to the flow of air they are embedded in.
Statement 4: It is a circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System. Hence incorrect.

19 Shallow V-shaped valleys in the development of a river course is often found when
a)  the river is old
b)  the river is traversing near ox-bow lakes
c)  the river is in its youth stage
d)  the river is carrying a high sediment load
Answer: C
A river course goes over several phases of development or maturity. Each phase affects its major characteristics.
When a river is young, undercutting by the river is not significant enough to create deep valleys in its way.
As the river gets older, undercutting (river bed) erodes shallow valleys. So, option
(c) is correct.
The characteristics of each of the stages of landscapes developing in running water regimes may be summarised as follows:
Youth stage
Few streams that with poor integration flowing through original slopes
Shallow V-shaped valleys; deep gradients
Stream divides are broad with marshes, swamps etc. Waterfalls and rapids may exist where hard rocks are there
Mature stage
Plenty streams with good integration; mild gradients
Deep V-shaped valleys
Broader meandering floodplains Water divides turn sharper Waterfalls and rapids disappear
Old Stage
Smaller tributaries flowing over gentle gradients
Divides are broad and flat with lakes
Streams meander freely forming natural leeves, ox-bow lakes
Most of the landscape is either at or above sea level.

20 Which of the following about the "Transformative Carbon Asset Facility (TCAF)" launched recently by the World Bank is NOT correct?
a)  It will help developing countries pay for emission reductions.
b)  It is market-based scheme.
c)  The scheme would support waste management projects.
d)  It will be made a binding protocol under the UNFCCC.
Answer: D
UNFCCC itself is not binding on countries unless they agree to a target set under it. Moreover, it will not be made a protocol. Hence, (d) is wrong.
The World Bank has launched a $500 million dollars Transformative Carbon Asset Facility (TCAF) to help developing countries pay for emission reductions and combat climate change.
It is market-based scheme specially designed to help developing countries and would establish the world's first programmatic carbon market.
The scheme will reward countries for reducing emissions by paying a fee for each tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduced. The facility will help countries implement their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).

21 Consider the following statements about the coasts of India.
1.  The west coast of our country is a high rocky retreating coast.
2.  Erosional forms dominate in the west coast instead of depositional forms.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
High rocks coast features:
Highly indented
Formation of wave-cut platforms in front of the sea cliff due to constant water erosional action
Material eroded in such manner, deposits along the off-shore forming wave terraces.
Several depositions like this results in the formation of barrier bars and spits that break block the sea water forming a lagoon.
Low Sedimentary coast features: Lagoons, deltas etc. found
Lagoons eventually turn into swamps which turn into coastal plains
Storm and tsunami waves cause darastic changes in the supply of depositional material

22 India and Pakistan have agreed to resume structured dialogue between them through new 10-point Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue (CBD) which includes the 'Sir Creek Dispute'. This dispute is on division of territorial rights on
a)  A mountain peak near Siachen
b)  Construction of a barrage on Wular
c)  A tidal estuary near Gujarat
d)  The Greater part of Kashmir
Answer: C
The 10-point CBD includes - Siachen issue, Peace and security, confidence building measures (CBMs), Jammu and Kashmir, Sir Creek, Wular barrage, religious tourism etc.
Sir Creek is a 96 km tidal estuary on the border of India and Pakistan. The creek, which opens up into the Arabian Sea, divides the Gujarat state of India from the Sindh province of Pakistan.
The dispute lies in the interpretation of the maritime boundary line between Pakistan and India. Before independence, the area was part of Sind Province of British India. After independence in 1947, Sindh became a part of Pakistan while Gujarat
remained a part of India.

23 Which of the following have caused a threat to Mangrove forests throughout the world?
1.  Dams and irrigation reducing the amount of water reaching mangrove forests
2.  Destruction of coral reefs
3.  Oil pollution in mangrove waters
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
Statement 1: River changes are caused due to dams and irrigation reducing the amount of water reaching mangrove forests. This changes the salinity level of water in the forest. If salinity becomes too high, the mangroves cannot
survive. Freshwater diversions can also lead to mangroves drying out.
Statement 2: Coral reefs provide the first barrier against currents and strong waves. When they are destroyed, the stronger-than-normal waves and currents reaching the coast can undermine the fine sediment in which the mangroves grow. This can prevent seedlings from taking root and wash away nutrients essential for mangrove ecosystems.
Statement 3: Oil pollution can smother mangrove roots and suffocate the trees.

24 Water vapour in the atmosphere, in percentage terms, generally
1.  Increases with altitude
2.  Decreases with the distance from equator towards poles
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
Water vapour is a variable gas in the atmosphere, which decreases with altitude. This is also the reason why the greenhouse warming caused by water vapour decreases with altitude. So, 1 is incorrect.
In the warm and wet tropics, it may account for four per cent of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold areas of desert and polar regions, it may be less than one per cent of the air. Water vapour content thus also decreases from the equator towards the poles. So, 2 is correct.

25 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): The earth as a whole neither accumulates heat nor looses it.
2.  Reason (R): Circulation of magma inside the earth, primordial heat and radioactive decay keep the earth heated.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.A is correct, but R
is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: B
The earth receives almost all of its energy from the sun. The earth in turn radiates back to space the energy received from the sun. As a result, the earth neither warms up nor does it get cooled over a period of time. Hence, A is correct, and R is not the reason for it.

26 At perihelion, earth is the nearest to the sun receiving more solar insolation than at aphelion. However, this variation in the solar output does not have a large effect on daily weather changes on earth at a certain point. This can be attributed to
1.  Solar winds
2.  Meteor showers
3.  Distribution of land and sea on earth
4.  Milankovitch effect
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 4 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: B
The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. Planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere is subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind. It is not related with the distribution of weather. So, 1 is wrong.
Meteor showers do not affect day to day weather on earth. So, 2 is also wrong. Distribution of land and sea, heat transfer by way of sea and land breezes etc
redistribute the increased insolation so that the effects are not felt largely. So, 3 is
correct.
Milankovitch effect refer to change in axis, shape and tilt of earth's spin. It is relevant to long term climate change, and not in this context which is about short- term weather changes. So, 4 is also wrong.

27 Consider the following statements about the post of National Security Advisor, India.
1.  He is appointed by the Parliament.
2.  He reports directly to the intelligence agencies of India.
3.  He heads the National Security Council.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
He is appointed by the PM, not the Parliament. So, 1 is wrong.
Intelligence agencies like RAW, IB report to him, and not the opposite. So, 2 is wrong.
He is the chief executive of the NSC, not its head. So, 3 is also wrong.
The National Security Adviser (NSa) is tasked with regularly advising the Prime Minister on all matters relating to internal and external threats to the country, and oversees strategic issues.
The NSA of India also serves as the Prime Minister's Special Interlocutor on border issues with China, and frequently accompanies the Prime Minister on Foreign State visits.
Brajesh Mishra was appointed the first National Security Adviser of India. The post was created in 1998 by the Government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

29 Which of the following factors do NOT affect temperature at a particular place on earth?
a)  Ocean waves
b)  Relief of the place
c)  Its distance from equator
d)  Wind circulation
Answer: A
Ocean Waves in a given area reflect the type of weather in an area.
Out of all the factors mentioned here, they affect the temperature distribution the least. Ocean 'currents' do. Ocean currents, warm or cold, carry heat/coolness from one sea region to the other and affect the temperature distribution. So, (a) is the answer.
Relief affects by making the place cold/hot. So, (b) can't be the answer. Distance from equator affects the amount of solar insolation received and the
temperature. So, (c) can't be the answer.
Wind circulation redistributes temperature in a region. So, (d) also can't be the answer.

30 A particular plant growth hormone delays the biological aging of plants which allows fruits to be left longer on the tree so as to extend the market period. The Hormone is
a)  Auxin
b)  Cytokinin
c)  Gibberellins
d)  Abscisic acid
Answer: C
Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate growth and influence various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination,
dormancy, flowering, sex expression, enzyme induction, and leaf and fruit senescence.
Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay aging. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period.
GA3 is used to speed up the malting process in brewing industry. Go to the question source and read about various PGRs briefly.

31 Which of the following ocean currents blow in the Indian Ocean?
1.  Labrador current
2.  Agulhas Current
3.  Kuroshio current
4.  Humboldt current
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  1 and 4 only
c)  2 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: C
You need to eliminate here. If you know that Kuroshio Current flows near Japan, you can eliminate options (a) and (d).
Also, Labrador Current is a well-known ocean current that flows in North Atlantic, not Indian Ocean. So, (b) will also be wrong.
By elimination, the only option you will have is (c).
Agulhas is the western boundary current of the southwest Indian Ocean. It flows down the east coast of Africa from 27°S to 40°S. It is narrow, swift and strong. It is even suggested that the Agulhas is the largest western boundary current in the world ocean.
The Agulhas acts as an oceanic convergence zone. Due to mass continuity this drives surface waters down, resulting in the upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water south of the current. Additionally, the convergence tends to increase the concentration of plankton in and around the Agulhas. Both of these factors result in the area being one of enhanced primary productivity as compared to the surrounding waters.

32 In India, the day temperature is maximum in May and not after the summer solstice. This is due to
a)  Arrival of southwest monsoons after Summer Solstice
b)  Passing of Western cyclonic disturbances after Summer Solstice
c)  Occurrence of Indian Ocean Dipole in the month of May
d)  Greater formation of Ozone hole in the months before Summer Solstice
Answer: A
The southwest monsoons arrive at the Kerala coast and advance further inland in June and July. These winds have cooling effect and thus summer solstice in June is cooler than May. So, (a) is correct.
Western disturbances largely affect India in the winter season. So, (b) is incorrect. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the Indian Nino, is an irregular
oscillation of sea-surface temperatures in which the western Indian Ocean becomes
alternately warmer and then colder than the eastern part of the ocean. The IOD also affects the strength of monsoons over the Indian subcontinent. But, this is not the causal factor. So, (c) is not correct.

33 Tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator because
a)  Sea temperatures are not high enough to form a cyclone
b)  The wind flow pattern in the region reduces chances of formation of a tropical cyclone
c)  Atmospheric pressure at tropical areas is higher than adjoining sub-tropics
d)  There is absence of a warm and cold front in tropical regions
Answer: B
A temperature of 27 degree Celsius is needed to form conditions for a tropical cyclone. Sea temperatures conditions are fulfilled at equator. So, (a) is wrong.
Coriolis force is absent at the equator. Due to this, winds blowing from high pressure sub-tropics to low pressure tropics (hence option (c) wrong), do not form a circulatory pattern around a low pressure zone. Instead, they simply fill the low pressure zone. So, (b) is the answer.
Warm and cold fronts are required for extra-tropical cyclones. So, (d) is also wrong.

34 Rainfall generally increases as we proceed from
1.  Coastal areas to interior areas
2.  Poles to equator
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
Statement 1: The reverse is true because coastal areas higher evaporation, moisture and cloud formation than interior areas. Moreover, any moisture-laden winds from ocean will first hit the coastal areas and then interior areas. Moisture would go on reducing as the wind advance further in. So, 1 is incorrect.
Poles receive lesser solar insolation, have lesser evaporation and rainfall. Reverse is true for equator. So, 2 is correct.

35 Electrocardiography is based on the fact that
a)  The heart shows electric activity which can be recorded
b)  Beating of the heart generated microwaves that can be read by an instrument
c)  Heart is connected to the brain which generates noticeable magnetic waves that can be graphed
d)  The biological energy drawn by the heart from the body can be mapped on a
device
Answer: A
The electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a diagnostic tool that is routinely used to assess the electrical and muscular functions of the heart.
The heart is a two stage electrical pump and the heart's electrical activity can be measured by electrodes placed on the skin.
Like the spark-plug of an automobile the heart generates a number of "sparks" per minute. Each "spark" travels across a specialized electrical pathway and stimulates the muscle walls of the heart to contract and expand in a certain way.

36 How do occurrence of 'solar spots' on Sun may affect climate on earth?
1.  Change in solar output
2.  Change in earth's magnetic activity
3.  Change in earth's axial tilt
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  1 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the photosphere of the Sun that appear visibly as dark spots compared to surrounding regions.
They reduce solar output if increase in number. So, 1 is correct.
They reflect intense magnetic activity on the Sun at those spots, and not earth. So, 2 is incorrect.
Change in earth's axial tilt is a long-term phenomenon. So, 3 is incorrect.

37 During winter the vehicles with closed doors and windows remain warmer than the temperature outside. This may be due to
a)  Greenhouse effect
b)  Heat Conduction by metallic frame of vehicle
c)  Ionizing radiation effect
d)  High pollution outside the vehicle
Answer: A
Option (b) is not relevant to the question, as it talks about vehicles with closed door and windows.
Ionizing radiation is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. It is not relevant here; hence (c) is also wrong.
High pollution outside may actually keep vehicle surroundings warm rather than the opposite. So, (d) is also wrong.
A greenhouse is made up of glass. The glass which is transparent to incoming short wave solar radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave radiation. The glass, therefore, allows in more radiation and prevents the long wave radiation going outside the glass ouse, causing the temperature inside the glasshouse structure warmer than outside.
When you enter a car or a bus, during summers, where windows are closed, you feel more heat than outside. Likewise during winter the vehicles with closed doors and windows remain warmer than the temperature outside.

38 Osmosis performs which of the following functions in plants?
1.  It helps plants in photosynthesis.
2.  The roots absorb water through osmosis.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Concept:Osmosis is the diffusion of fluid through a semi-permeable membrane from a solution with a low solute concentration to a solution with a higher solute concentration until there is an equal solute concentration on both sides of the
membrane.
Statement 1: Stomata are responsible for plant gas exchange which enables the process of photosynthesis. On every plant leaf there are many guard cells that literally "guard" the stomata. During osmosis, the guard cells swell with water and the pressure triggers the stomata to open. When the stomata open they
suck in carbon dioxide from the air which is then used in combination with the water from the roots and the sunlight absorbed in chlorophyll to produce plant energy.
Statement 2: Roots reach out into the soil to establish an avenue for the transport of nutrients and water to the rest of the plant. The roots absorb water through osmosis. If the water concentration outside of the plant roots is greater than that of the water concentration in the roots osmosis occurs.

39 The Bay of Fundy in Canada is known for
a)  Highest amount of freshwater flooding the seas
b)  Highest tidal range in the world
c)  Having largest number of natural harbour sites
d)  Highest frequency of cyclones hitting a bay in the world
Answer: B
In the Bay of Fundy they occur in Nova Scotia, Canada.
The tidal bulge is 15 - 16 m. Because there are two high tides and two low tides every day (roughly a 24 hour period); then a tide must come in within about a six hour period. As a rough estimate, the tide rises about 240 cm an hour (1,440 cm divided by 6 hours).
If you have walked down a beach with a steep cliff alongside (which is common there), make sure you watch the tides. If you walk for about an hour and then notice that the tide is coming in, the water will be over your head before you get back to where you started!

40 Which of the following forces influence ocean currents?
1.  Gravity
2.  Solar energy
3.  Rotation of earth
4.  Salinity variations in water
5.  Underwater earthquakes
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2, 3 and 4 only
b)  1 and 5 only
c)  1, 2, 3 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope. So, 1 is correct.
Solar energy makes current warm or cold and decides their circulatory patterns. So,
2 is correct.
Surface currents are generated largely by wind. Their patterns are determined by wind direction, Coriolis forces from the Earth's rotation, and the position of landforms that interact with the currents. So, 3 is correct.
Currents may also be generated by density differences in water masses caused by temperature and salinity variations. These currents move water masses through the deep ocean-taking nutrients, oxygen, and heat with them. So, 4 is correct.
Occasional events also trigger serious currents. Huge storms move water masses. Underwater earthquakes may trigger devastating tsunamis. So, 5 is correct.

41 The mixing of warm and cold currents favour the growth of planktons. Why?
a)  It moderates sea surface water temperatures.
b)  It brings nutrient rich deep water to the surface.
c)  It increases amount of sunlight available to planktons.
d)  It raises sea water levels facilitating their growth.
Answer: B
Concept:There is a fundamental problem phytoplankton in the open ocean have to face.
They need both sunlight and nutrients (such as nitrate and phosphate) to be able to photosynthesize.
Sunlight is only available in the uppermost layers. During photosynthesis, the nutrients are quickly used up by phytoplankton so they are not available for long periods in the upper layers under normal circumstances.
This is indeed the case in tropical waters, and as a result they are very unproductive.
To escape this problem the seawater needs to be mixed regularly to bring the nutrient rich deep waters up to the sunlight zone where the phytoplankton can grow.
This is one of the reasons why areas where cold and warm currents meet are very productive; the collision of currents causes mixing. Hence, (b) is correct.
Planktons are the primary food for fish population. So, the best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in these mixing zones

42 Jataka tales have been painted in
a)  Warli Temple
b)  Ajanta Caves
c)  Lepakshi Temple
d)  Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka
Answer: B
Ajanta is among the finest examples of some of the earliest Buddhist architecture, cave paintings and sculptures.
Among the most interesting paintings are the Jataka tales, illustrating diverse stories relating to the previous incarnations of the Buddha as Bodhisattava, a saintly being
who is destined to become the Buddha.
Declared as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO since 1983, the paintings and sculptures of Ajanta (and Ellora), considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious art, have had a great influence in the development of art in India.
The scenes of Mahajanaka Jataka in cave No.1 are the best surviving examples of
Ajanta paintings belonging to this period.
In a scene Prince Mahajanaka - the future Buddha, discusses the problems of the kingdom with his mother, the queen who is shown in an extremely graceful pose and is surrounded by maids.

43 Which of the following defines a "biome" most appropriately?
a)  Community of flora and fauna that covers a large geographical area
b)  Geographical areas that harbour large range of endemic species
c)  A meeting boundary of several Ecotones
d)  An ecological niche of a particular species
Answer: A
Concept:In the diagram below, several levels of ecosystem have been given.
If you can't see the image, look up the first image at
http://eschooltoday.com/ecosystems/levels-of-organisation-in-an-ecosystem.html
A biome may or may not have a collection of endemic species. So, (b)
is incorrect.
A biome is a large geographical area and not a meeting boundary. So, (c) is incorrect.
A biome harbours a large number of species, and not a particular species. So, (d) is incorrect.
Some of the major biomes of the world are: forest, grassland, desert and tundra biomes.

44 Soil that is acidic, poor in nutrients with thin cover can be found in
1.  Boreal forests
2.  Tropical Deciduous forests
3.  Temperate forests
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
About Boreal forests:The Boreal Forest is the term applied to the huge area of dense coniferous forests of North America, northern Europe and Asia occurring at high latitudes where the climate is characterised by very cold winters, usually about
40cm of rainfall and a short summer growing season.
The dominant species are evergreens, such as pine, spruce, fir, whose water loss through transpiration is low in winter at the time when the soils may be permanently frozen.
Unlike tropical forests which have a huge range of species, the boreal forest usually have rather few species of trees, shrubs and plants. In fact the undergrowth of boreal forests is almost non-existent. The species present are able to get their nutrient requirements from the very shallow layer of soil above the permafrost. The trees present have a notable climatic tolerance and survive on rather infertile soils. Pines survive on very sandy soils like those in northern Europe whereas spruce requires more loamy and clayey soils with more nutrients.

45 Which of the following purposes are NOT served by Pinus tree?
a)  It can metabolise excess nitrogen oxide in atmosphere.
b)  It can be used to produce resins.
c)  It can be used for phytoremediation.
d)  It can cut down ionizing radiation.
Answer: D
Certain plants e.g., Pinus, Juniparus, Quercus, Pyrus and Vitis can metabolise nitrogen oxide and therefore, their plantation could help in this matter. So, (a) is correct.
Phytoremediation is defined as the use of plants to remove pollutants from the environment or to render them harmless. Some species of Pinus have been used both as a bioindicator of presence of contaminated metal as well to help remove them.
So, (c) is correct.

46 Which of the following can be called "Bajada"?
a)  A large mass of subsurface intrusive igneous rock that has its origins from mantle magma.
b)  Zone in the Earth's mantle that exhibits plastic properties
c)  A body of air whose temperature and humidity characteristics remain constant throughout several climatic regions
d)  A Consecutive series of alluvial fans
Answer: D
Concept:They are consecutive series of alluvial fans forming along the edge of a linear mountain range.
Surface of this feature undulates in a rolling fashion as one moves from the centre of one alluvial fan to another. It normally occurs in arid climates.
Option (a) is batholiths. Option (b) is aesthenosphere. Option (c) is similar to an air mass, but not quite the same.

47 Which of the following can be used to disinfect water?
1.  Ozone
2.  UV radiation
3.  Iodine
4.  Bromine
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
Iodine and Bromine act as a disinfectant against Escherichia coli. They are however less powerful than chlorine. So, 3 and 4 are correct.
Ozone can be bubbled through the water, breaking down all parasites, bacteria, and all other harmful organic substances. So, 1 is correct.
UV treatment of water disinfection leaves no residue in the water due to use of light
instead of chemical disinfectants. 2 is also correct.

48 DDT, which is also known as an insecticide, has adverse affect on ecological health because
a)  It is a persistent organic pollutant.
b)  It increases susceptibility to fungal infectionin birds.
c)  It impairs metabolic functions in plants.
d)  It depletes tropospheric ozone.
Answer: A
DDT is a persistent organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure contributing to terrestrial organisms. So, (a) is correct.
Other pesticides impair metabolic functions in birds, rodents etc.
Depending on conditions, its soil half life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water itself.

49 Higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere can
1.  Increase the rate of photosynthesis in plants
2.  Cause acute respiratory diseases in children
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
The irritant red haze in the traffic and congested places is due to oxides of nitrogen.
Higher concentrations of NO2 damage the leaves of plants and retard the rate of photosynthesis. So, 1 is incorrect.
Nitrogen dioxide is a lung irritant that can lead to an acute respiratory disease in children. It is toxic to living tissues also. So, 2 is correct.
Nitrogen dioxide is also harmful to various textile fibres and metals.

53 Which of the following help in the formation of Ozone hole?
1.  Equatorial Westward drift currents
2.  Polar stratospheric clouds
3.  Equatorial mesospheric clouds
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
 Mesospheric clouds are the highest clouds in Earth's atmosphere, located in the mesosphere at altitudes of around 76 to 85 kilometres. They don't deplete ozone layer. So, 3 is incorrect.
Ocean currents too don't deplete ozone layer. So, 1 is incorrect.
 In summer season, nitrogen dioxide and methane react with chlorine monoxide and chlorine atoms forming chlorine sinks, preventing much ozone depletion, whereas in winter, special type of clouds called polar stratospheric clouds are formed over Antarctica.
These polar stratospheric clouds provide surface on which chlorine nitrate formed and facilitate the process of ozone depletion. So, 2 is correct.

54 Which of the following contaminants are found in groundwater in India?
1.  Arsenic
2.  Fluoride
3.  Nitrate
4.  Sulphate
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2, 3 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Arsenic pollution of ground water in West Bengal was first reported in the early eighties. The occurrence of arsenic is mainly due to two reasons: natural and anthropogenic. So, 1 is correct.
High concentrations of fluoride in ground water are common in some of the semi- arid areas of Rajasthan, southern Punjab, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and southern Haryana. So, 2 is correct.
Groundwater in at least 387 districts has high nitrate levels. So, 3 is correct.
The sulphate content in groundwater is high in regions like Haridwar and Dehradun. So, 4 is correct.

55 Which of the following sectors in India is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in India?
a)  Agriculture
b)  Energy
c)  Textile Industry
d)  Automobile Industry
Answer: B
 The energy sector accounts for two-thirds the total emissions, followed by agriculture (20 per cent), industrial processes (5.8 per cent) and waste (3.4 per cent).
The forestry sector was a net absorber; carbon absorption by forests amount to
222,567 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
Among gases, CO2 is the largest contributor to GHG emissions at 67.25%, followed by methane with a contribution of 26.73% and nitrous oxide, 5%.

56 Which of the following can be related with 'transpiration' in plants?
1.  Cool leaf surfaces
2.  Humidity of rainforests
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through the stomata in the leaves which cools them. So, 1 is correct.
The humidity of rainforests is largely due to the vast cycling of water from root to leaf to atmosphere and back to the soil, i.e. due to transpiration. So, 2 is correct.
 Transpiration has more than one purpose; it
creates transpiration pull for absorption and transport of plants supplies water for photosynthesis
transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant
cools leaf surfaces, sometimes 10 to 15 degrees, by evaporative cooling maintains the shape and structure of the plants by keeping cells turgid

57 Rh grouping in human blood is NOT relevant to which of the following?
a)  Safety of foetus
b)  Coagulation of blood
c)  Blood donation
d)  It is relevant to all of the above.
Answer: B
 An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies against the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched before transfusions. So, (c) is related.
During the delivery of the first child, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood (if Rh-ve) to small amounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. So, (a) is correct.
An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting. So, (b) is the answer.

58 Occurrence of several "interglacial periods" is an indicator of which of the following?
a)  Loss of atmosphere several times
b)  Disappearance of Ozone layer several times
c)  Presence of life on a planet
d)  Climate change on the planet
Answer: D
 An interglacial period (or alternatively interglacial) is a geological interval of warmer global average temperature lasting thousands of years that separates consecutive glacial periods within an ice age.
Evidence of multiple advances and retreats of glaciers, and the sediment deposits in glacial lakes reveal the occurrence of warm and cold periods in the history of earth. It is a strong evidence of climate change. Hence (d) is the answer.
 Tree rings also show evidence for wet and dry periods. Also, for e.g. near Rajasthan, 3000-1700 BC was a period of higher rainfall, with 2000-1700 BC supporting Harappan civilization. Dry conditions accentuated since then.
These are used to study phenomenon of climate change in a region.

59 Gravity anomaly at different places on earth can be attributed to
1.  Uneven distribution of mass of the material in the crust of the earth
2.  Variation of magnetic field lines near the poles
Which of the above is/are true?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The gravity values differ according to the mass of material. The uneven distribution of mass of material within the earth influences this value.
These readings differ from the expected values. Such a difference is called gravity anomaly. Hence, 1 is correct.
Magnetic field, in the ordinary sense, does not affect gravitational values. So, 2 is incorrect.
 The gravitation force (g) is not the same at different latitudes on the surface. It is greater near the poles and less at the equator. This is because of the distance from the centre at the equator being greater than that at the poles.

60 While travelling through the land and seas in Southern Hemisphere, you would notice a milder climate than at the same latitude northwards in Northern Hemisphere. Why?
1.  Southern Hemisphere is at a higher mean sea level (MSL) than Northern hemisphere.
2.  Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, except in the Antarctic which is colder than the Arctic. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.
So, 2 is correct.
The difference in MSL between both hemispheres is not significant enough to cause milder climates in Southern hemisphere. As explained above, it is actually due to continentality. So, 1 is incorrect.

61 The phenomenon of 'Photoperiodism' is related to
a)  Some plants responding to exposure of light to induce flowering.
b)  Behaviour of plants that perform photosynthesis only during particular times of the day
c)  Some plants that synthesize solar energy more efficiently
d)  Behaviour of plants that flower at low temperatures
Answer: A
 Option (d) is called vernalization. It prevents premature reproductive development late in the growing season, and enables the plant to have sufficient time to reach maturity.
 It has been observed that some plants require a periodic exposure to light to induce flowering. It is also seen that such plants are able to measure the duration of exposure to light.
Flowering in certain plants depends not only on a combination of light and dark exposures but also their relative durations. This response of plants to periods of day/night is termed photoperiodism.

63 Which of the following can be carcinogenic?
1.  Asbestos
2.  Processed meat
3.  Ultraviolet radiation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
Substances and exposures that can lead to cancer are called carcinogens. Carcinogens do not cause cancer in every case, all the time. Substances labeled as carcinogens may have different levels of cancer-causing potential. Some may cause cancer only after prolonged, high levels of exposure. And for any particular person, the risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including how they are exposed to a carcinogen, the length and intensity of the exposure, and the person's genetic makeup.
 WHO has recently declared processed meat as carcinogenic. So, 2 is correct.
Higher-energy radiation, including ultraviolet radiation (present in sunlight), x-rays, and gamma radiation, generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. For most people, ultraviolet radiation from sunlight is the commonest cause of skin cancer. So, 3 is correct.

64 Which of the following act as a costal defence against tsunamis and cyclones?
1.  Beach sand dunes
2.  Mangroves
3.  Barrier Islands
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Stable sand dunes play an important part in protecting the coastline. They act as a buffer against wave damage during storms. So, 1 is correct.
Mangroves have strong roots and are spread widely so they act as second line of defence. So, 2 is correct.
Barrier islands come in the way of tsunami waves as they are located away from the coasts in the sea. So, 3 is also correct.

65 Why does the equator receive comparatively less insolation than the tropics despite being at zero latitude?
1.  Zero coriolis force
2.  More cloudiness
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Zero coriolis force would mean that winds are not deflected with great force at the equator, as they are the sub-tropics. But, direction of wind will only affect the distribution of heat, and not the amount of insolation actually received from the Sun. So, 1 is incorrect.
Generally, at the same latitude the insolation is more over the continent than over the oceans, because oceans are cloudier due to greater evaporation. Similarly in equator, evaporation is high, cloudiness is high and rains are frequent. Clouds reflect incoming solar insolation and send it back to space. So, 2 is correct.

66 Digital MLAs initiative in Maharashtra is related to
a)  An online portal for public grievances addressed to MLAs
b)  Digitization of the legislative process
c)  Online election of legislative offices
d)  A digital map of all MLA constituencies with their administrative details for greater accountability and transparency
Answer: B
 This system has been launched in an effort of state government to move towards complete digitization of the legislative process that aims at bringing the paper work to minimum.
All MLAs and MLCs have been given unique user names and passwords to access to website so that they can send their questions and requests online.
It facilitates them to move different motions like calling attention and half-an-hour discussion questions for legislature sessions.

68 Earth is largely protected from the solar wind by
a)  Magnetic field
b)  Ozone Layer
c)  Tropospheric weather phenomena
d)  Continuous revolution around the Sun
Answer: A
The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. This plasma consists of mostly electrons, protons and alpha particles.
The solar winds flow outward supersonically at varying speeds and have the potential of stripping a planet's atmosphere.
 Where the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well- developed magnetic field (such as Earth, Jupiter and Saturn), the particles are deflected by the Lorentz force. This region, known as the magnetosphere, causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. So, (a) is correct.
However, on earth some of the charged particles are trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the aurora and geomagnetic storms.

69 In a river course, what do "Alluvial fans" refer to?
a)  Well stratified delta deposits near the sea
b)  Riverine islands made by tributaries near the mouth of the sea
c)  Unstratified coarse load in the upper reaches of the river
d)  Rapids formed due to undercutting in the upper reaches of the river
Answer: C
 Alluvial fans and Delta have some similarities, yet some key differences.
The key difference is that Alluvia fans are formed away from the sea in the upper reaches of the river (i.e. not far away from its source). So, option (a) and (b) can be eliminated.
 Process of formation of Alluvial fans
Water flowing from a higher level breaks down into foot slope plains of low gradient
Normally very coarse load is carried by streams in the upper reaches transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant
It becomes too heavy to carry and is deposited in low to high cone shaped deposit called alluvial fan
No stratification of river load a all the material (fine and coarse) is dumped together
Streams making alluvial fans eventually shifts course forming many channels called distributaries

71 The basic source of all minerals on earth is
a)  Asteroids
b)  Magma
c)  Solar winds
d)  Churning of the Ocean basin
Answer: B
 Magma cools slowly as it rises towards Earth's surface. It can take thousands to millions of years to become solid when it is trapped inside Earth.
As the magma cools, solid rocks form (igneous).
These rocks are mixtures of minerals. Granite is a common rock that forms when magma cools. Granite contains the minerals quartz, plagioclase feldspar, and potassium feldspar.
The same igneous rock can be eroded, weathered, transported, deposited and consolidated as sedimentary rocks which are the source of non-metallic minerals.

73 Doldrums near the equatorial regions are
a)  Regions of light ocean currents and winds within the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ)
b)  Regions of high ocean currents and strong winds that oscillate from the northern to southern sub-tropics
c)  Regions where deep ocean currents are found
d)  The typhoons formed near the ITCZ
Answer: A
 Doldrums, also called equatorial calms, are equatorial regions of light ocean currents and winds within the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a belt of converging winds and rising air encircling Earth near the Equator.
The northeast and southeast trade winds meet there; this meeting causes air uplift and often produce clusters of convective thunderstorms. They occur along the Equator in the Indian and western Pacific oceans and slightly north of the Equator off the African and Central American west coasts.
The crews of sailing ships dreaded the doldrums because their ships were often becalmed there; the designation for the resultant state of depression was apparently thus extended to these geographic regions themselves.

74 Consider the following about electricity generated from the use of biomass gasification plants
1.  It can be used to power only small computing devices and not industries.
2.  Wood and metals can also be gasified and used.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 The Ministry of New and renewable Energy is running a biomass gasifier programme. The focus of the programme is to meet captive electrical and thermal needs of rice mills. So, 1 is incorrect.
A variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, waste wood, plastics and aluminium, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Refuse-derived fuel (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, crop residues etc. So, 2 is correct.

75 Use of Chlorine to purify water is quite popular. What role does it play in water purification?
1.  It is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms
2.  It quickens the sedimentation of solid particles in water.
3.  It converts uranium in water to a less harmful form.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
 Chlorine is a fast-acting disinfectant. So, 1 is correct.
In particular, chlorination is used to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid etc.
 Disinfection by chlorination can be problematic, in some circumstances. Chlorine can react with naturally occurring organic compounds found in the water supply to produce compounds known as disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which are mainly responsible for health hazards.

76 Which of the following are the characteristics of La Nina?
1.  Tropical pacific trade winds become very weak
2.  Abnormal accumulation of hot water occurs in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
  The conditions are exactly the opposite of the given in the statements. La Nina conditions are opposite to that of El Nino.
La Niña refers to the extensive cooling of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, often accompanied by warmer than normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western Pacific, and to the north of Australia. So, both 1 and 2 are incorrect.
Changes to the atmosphere and ocean circulation during La Niña events include:
Sustained cooler-than-usual SSTs across the central and eastern tropical
Pacific Ocean.
Increased convection or cloudiness over tropical Australia, Papua New- Guinea, and Indonesia.
An increase in strength of the trade winds (easterlies) across the tropical
Pacific Ocean (but not necessarily in the Australian region).

77 Which of the following birds migrate to India from other regions?
1.  Wood Sandpiper
2.  Greater Flamingo
3.  Brown-fronted woodpecker
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 Indian subcontinent plays host to a number of migratory birds in summers as well as winters over a hundred species of migratory birds fly to India, either in search of feeding grounds of to escape the severe winter of their native habitat.
Usually, Kingfisher, Rosy, Pelican, Wood Sandpiper, Starling Bluethroat, Long billed Pipit birds start migrating. Other birds like Siberian Cranes, Greater Flamingo, Ruff and Black winged Stilt prefer to fly at a higher altitude while migrating. As Winter sets in, migratory birds from Magnolia, Siberia, and Europe can be seen.

78 Which of the following statements about Phytoplankton is INCORRECT?
a)  They are the foundation of the aquatic food web.
b)  They grow in ocean regions where iron concentrations are very low.
c)  They can cause "red tide" in oceans.
d)  In the event of their mass mortality, oxygen supply in ocean water would be
adversely affected suffocating many species to death.
Answer: B
 Phytoplankton growth depends on the availability of carbon dioxide, sunlight, and nutrients. They require trace amounts of iron which limits phytoplankton growth in large areas of the ocean because iron concentrations are very low. So, (b) is incorrect.
Phytoplanktons are the foundation of the aquatic food web, the primary producers, feeding everything from microscopic, animal-like zooplankton to multi-ton whales. So, (a) is correct.
Phytoplankton can also be the harbingers of death or disease. Certain species of phytoplankton produce powerful biotoxins, making them responsible for so-called "red tides," or harmful algal blooms. These toxic blooms can kill marine life and people who eat contaminated seafood. So, (c) is correct.
Phytoplankton cause mass mortality in other ways. In the aftermath of a massive bloom, dead phytoplankton sink to the ocean or lake floor. The bacteria that decompose the phytoplankton deplete the oxygen in the water, suffocating animal life; the result is a dead zone. So, (d) is correct.

79 Which of the following can be examples where capillarity is in play?
1.  Drainage of constantly produced tear fluid from the eye
2.  Absorption of water by paper towels
3.  Drawing ink to the tips of fountain pen nibs
4.  Flow of oil in large pipelines
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: D
It is defined as the movement of water within the spaces of a porous material due to the forces of adhesion, cohesion, and surface tension.
Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel will cause an upward force on the liquid
at the edges and result in a meniscus which turns upward. The surface tension acts to hold the surface intact.
 How tears are drained is a little technical, so we skip the details here. But, 1 is correct as it happens due to capillarity.
Paper towels absorb liquid through capillary action, allowing a fluid to be
transferred from a surface to the towel. The small pores of a sponge also act as small capillaries. 2 is also correct.
Capillary action draws ink to the tips of fountain pen nibs from a reservoir or cartridge inside the pen. So, 3 is also correct.

80 Which of the following are declared tiger reserves in India?
1.  Jim Corbett
2.  Periyar
3.  Ranthambore

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: D
  Bhitarkanika is a national park and wildlife sanctuary.
So, 4 is incorrect.
Manas is a National Park, UNESCO Natural World Heritage site, a Project Tiger
Reserve, an Elephant Reserve and a Biosphere Reserve in Assam.
Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary (PNP) is a protected area in the districts of Idukki and Pathanamthitta in Kerala. It is notable as an elephant reserve and a tiger reserve.

b)  The co-dependent rise and fall of all beings in existence
c)  Buddha's victory over Mara
d)  That the ultimate spiritual wisdom comes from the earth
Answer: C
 This gesture is also called "touching the earth" mudra or "calling the earth to witness" mudra.
The right arm hangs down over the right knee. The hand with the palm turned inward and all the fingers extended downward with the finger touching the lotus throne.
The left hand lies on the lap with palm upward. This gesture symbolizes
Shakyamunis victory over Mara.
Other mudras can be understood here http://www.buddhas-online.com/mudras.html
Buddhism is a hot favourite of UPSC.

82 What do you understand by the term "Sea floor spreading"?
a)  Forward advancement of the ocean floor towards shorelines
b)  Accumulation of thick organic deposits at the sea bed
c)  Expansion of new sea bed due to silt brought by freshwater rivers
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Constant eruptions at the crest of oceanic ridges cause the rupture of the oceanic crust and the new lava wedges into it, pushing the oceanic crust on either side. The ocean floor, thus spreads, known as sea floor spreading.
It is not caused due to organic material, nor silt etc. Hence, (a), (b) and (c) are wrong.
 Sea floor spreading is verified using these phenomena:
It was realised that all along the mid-oceanic ridges, volcanic eruptions are common and they bring huge amounts of lava to the surface in this area. The sediments on the ocean floor are unexpectedly very thin.
The age of the rocks increases as one moves away from the crest. The ocean crust rocks are much younger than the continental rocks. The sediments on the ocean floor are unexpectedly very thin.
The deep trenches have deep-seated earthquake occurrences while in the mid- oceanic ridge areas, the quake foci have shallow depths. It means lava is in close vicinity.

83 The "Home charges" mentioned in the drain theory by Dadabhai Naoroji included
1.  Profits from local trade monopolies by the British
2.  Remittances out of British official's income sent to Europe
3.  Charges of British administrative setup in India
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: B
 The drain was in two forms: a) official drain (also known as home charges); and b) private drain.
Home charges were made of three components:
Interest payable on Indian debt. Interest on the railways
Civil (e.g. Secretary of State office in London) and military charges.
Private drain included gifts, tributes, bribes, extortions, profits from local trade monopolies, remittances out of official's income to Europe etc.

84 The term "Ring of Fire" is used in the context of
a)  an active region of volcanoes and earthquakes
b)  a region of frequent forest fires in tropical rainforests across the equator
c)  a deep sea region of burning coal and petroleum that emits constant pollutants at the sea bed
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
 The Ring of Fire is an area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. In a 40,000 km
horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, volcanic arcs, and volcanic belts and/or plate movements.
It is home to over 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes. The Ring of
Fire is sometimes called the circum-Pacific belt.
About 90% of the world's earthquakes and 81% of the world's largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire.

85 Which of the following characteristics are desirable for a green manure crop?
1.  Shallow root system
2.  Rapid growth early in its life cycle
3.  Thorny leaves
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: D
The practice of ploughing or turning into soil under-composed green plant tissue for the purpose of improving physical condition as well as fertility of the soil
is referred to as green manuring and the manure obtained by this method is known as green manure.
 The deep rooting properties of many green manure crops make them efficient at suppressing weeds. Also, deep-rooted crops can recycle nutrients from deep in the soil. Shallow ones are not preferred. So, 1 is wrong.
The faster the green manure crops grow, the earlier it can be turned down in the soil to act as manure. So, 2 is correct.
A good green manure should have succulent tops so that organic matter is more. So,
3 is incorrect.

86 An earthquake would lead to a Tsunami if
1.  The epicentre of the earthquake lies just below land surface.
2.  It is accompanied with a cyclone.
3.  It happens in a high risk zone of earthquake in interior areas.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Tsunamis are waves generated by the tremors and not an earthquake in itself. The effect of tsunami would occur only if the epicentre of the tremor is
below oceanic waters and the magnitude is sufficiently high.
So, whether the earthquake occurs in a low risk zone or high risk zone, it it does not satisfy the above criterion, it may not cause tsunami.
So, all statements 1, 2 and 3 are wrong.

87 Consider the following about 'ASHA' with reference to the National Health Mission

88 Which of the following serve as evidence(s) for the acceleration or expansion of the
Universe?
1.  Exploding white dwarfs in space
2.  Fusion in huge stars
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of Type Ia supernovae, which are exploding white dwarfs who have exceeded their stability limit. So, 1 is correct.
Supernovae allow astronomers to measure the expansion rate of the Universe and hence determine how much mass there is in the Universe.

89 Which of the following pairs of geographical feature with region is matched
INCORRECTLY?
a)  Abyssinian Plateau: Africa
b)  Atlas Mountains: Northern Europe
c)  Guiana Highlands: South America
d)  Okavango Basin: South-western Africa
Answer: B
 Abyssinian Plateau is in Ehtiopia, Africa. So, (a) is correct.
Atlas Mountains are spread across north-western Africa, spanning Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. So, (b) is the answer.
The Guiana Highlands are a mountain range covering parts of Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. So, (c) is correct.
Okavango basin is in South-western Africa, which extends across portions of
Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. So, (d) is correct.

90 Jovian planets did not lose their gases, but many terrestrial planets did. Which of the following factor(s) may explain the loss of atmosphere from many terrestrial planets?
1.  The terrestrial planets are smaller and their lower gravity could not hold the escaping gases.
2.  Terrestrial planets being near to the Sun faced more intense solar winds.
Which of the above is/are true?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: Gravity attracts any atmosphere and keeps it intact with a terrestrial body, for e.g. that of earth. Gravity depends on mass and size of the planet. Since the terrestrial planets were small, gravity was less and gases escaped. So, 1 is correct.
The solar wind was most intense nearer the sun; so, it blew off lots of gas and dust from the terrestrial planets. The solar winds were not all that intense to cause similar removal of gases from the Jovian planets. So, 2 is also correct.
 Terrestrial planets are solid, e.g. Mercury, Venus, Mars, earth, whereas
Jovian planets are gassy.
The terrestrial planets were formed in the close vicinity of the parent star where it was too warm for gases to condense to solid particles. Jovian planets were formed at quite a distant location.

91 Consider the following statements about a national park.
1.  Dense, thick and semi evergreen and moist deciduous forest
2.  Entire territory is hilly.

a)  Dibru-Saikhowa National Park
b)  Dachigam National Park
c)  Anamudi Shola National Park
d)  Nokrek National Park
Answer: D
 Red Pandas are found in the sub Himalayan states of North East India - Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. The Red Panda's range extends across Nepal, Bhutan, China, Laos and Myanmar. It is found in areas within an altitude of
1500 to 4000 m.
Parks where they are found are Singalila National Park, Namdapha and Nokrek.

92 Why does the earth shake during an earthquake?
1.  Release of energy along a fault
2.  Collapse of the Mantle
Which of the above is/are true?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 It extends down to about 2,900 Km below the surface. If the entire mantle collapses, it will be catastrophic for the entire earth. 2 is a wrong statement.
 The release of energy occurs along a fault. A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rocks. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together.
However, their tendency to move apart at some point of time overcomes the friction. As a result, the blocks get deformed and eventually, they slide past one another abruptly. This causes a release of energy, and the energy waves travel in all directions.

93 Which of the following can be used as bio-fertilizer(s)?

94 Apart from HIV-AIDS, diseases that can be acquired during the tattooing process are
1.  Hepatitis - B
2.  Typhoid
3.  Ebola
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
 How can spread of disease through tattoing be avoided?
Professional tattoo shops should have in place a complete medical grade sterilization process that involves the use of an autoclave. An autoclave uses heat and pressure to sterilize surgical equipment of all kinds, and is used to clean the tubes that hold the tattooing needles.
The needles are single use only, and should be discarded in a medical waste container. The ink should not be shared, and the work surface should be sterilized in between customers.

95 If RBI raises the 'Bank Rate' it may lead to
a)  Inflow of higher FDI in the private banking sector
b)  Commercial loans becoming cheaper
c)  Destabilization of money markets
d)  Reduced investments and economic activity
Answer: D
Bank rate in India is determined by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It is the rate which at RBI gives loan to commercial banks without keeping any collateral. The RBI also provides short term loans to its clients (keeping collateral) which is called the repo rate.
 Option (a): It depends on the profitability of investments, the general business climate, ease of regulatory procedures, and global banking prospects. In fact, high bank rates may discourage new banks as they find it difficult to lure customers by giving low interest rate loans.
Option (b): Commercial loans will become costlier as banks will revise their interest rates upwards.
Option (c): Money markets are about short-term borrowing.
Option (d): High bank rates may lead to higher interest rates from banks and may discourage investment.

96 Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy can be described as one of the
a)  Rationalist school of Indian philosophy
b)  Ascetic school of Indian philosophy
c)  Devotionist school of Indian philosophy
d)  Ritualistic school of Indian philosophy
Answer: A
 Smkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities;
purua (consciousness) and prakti (matter).
Jiva (a living being) is that state in which purua is bonded to prakti in some form. This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of buddhi ("intellect")
and ahakra (ego consciousness). The universe is described by this school as one created by purusa-prakti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.
During the state of imbalance, one of more constituents overwhelms the others, creating a form of bondage, particularly of the mind. The end of this imbalance, bondage is called liberation, or kaivalya, by the Samkhya school.

97 Which of the following factors contribute to the flow of Equatorial counter-currents?
1.  Piling of water near the equator
2.  Coriolis force
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Equatorial counter-currents are major surface flows that carry water
eastward in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. They are located near the equator and are sandwiched between two westward-flowing currents, the North Equatorial Current and the South Equatorial Current. Equatorial counter-currents are unique, in that they flow in the opposite direction of the surface winds. The other major surface currents in the tropics flow in the same direction as the prevailing winds.
 The equatorial counter-currents are thus driven by a distinct surface wind pattern in the tropics. Strong westward trade winds result in westward surface flow
in most of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, several hundred miles north of the equator the winds are much weaker, in comparison. The stronger winds to the south pile up water where the winds are weak.
As a result, the surface of the ocean can be up to 6 inches higher. The excess water flows eastward under the influence of the Earth's rotation, giving rise to the equatorial counter-currents.
11th A similar question was asked in UPSC CSE Prelims 2015.

98 Limboo (Limbu) tribe can be found in which of the following states of India?
1.  Sikkim
2.  West Bengal

3.  Maharashtra
4.  Andhra Pradesh
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 Limbu tribes and clans are a Kirati people of Tibetan origin indigenous to the hill and mountainous regions of East Nepal between the Arun and Mechi rivers to as far as South Tibet, Bhutan, Darjeeling, Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland, and Burma.
So, you can eliminate all the Southern region options, 3 and 4, which means only (a)
can be the answer.
 Limbus practice many of their own life cycle rituals. They believe that lineage is not transmitted patrilineally. Rather, a woman inherits her mother's gods, and when she marries and lives with her husband she brings with her the deities that will then be recognized as the household deities.
Dhaka is the traditional fabric of the Limbus which are made by weaving it in geometric patterns in a handloomm. The art of making dhaka is taught by one generation to another.
In the olden days, the Limbus were skilled in silk farming. The Kiratis were also known as silk traders.

99 Consider the following with reference to the Treaty of Allahabad, 1765.
1.  It was entered into after the Battle of Buxar.
2.  As per the treaty, East Indian Company was granted Diwani rights.
Which of the above is/are INCORRECT?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 The Treaty of Allahabad was signed in 1765, between the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, Robert, Lord Clive, of the East India Company, as a result of the Battle of Buxar.
Based on the terms of the agreement, Alam granted the East India Company Diwani rights, or the right to collect taxes on behalf of the Emperor from the eastern province of Bengal-Bihar-Orissa.
Thus East India Company got appointed as the imperial tax collector for the Eastern province (Bengal-Bihar-Orissa). These rights allowed the Company to collect revenue directly from the people of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.
In return, the Company paid an annual tribute to the emperor.

100 The Union Cabinet has recently approved for signing MoU between India and Israel in the field of water resources management and development cooperation. How will India and Israel benefit from it?
1.  Israel being a water-abundant nation will be able to supply water to India through a land based pipeline.
2.  It settles understanding of territorial rights over water resources in the vicinity of both countries.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Israel is an arid country in West Asia. It has however pioneered techniques of efficiency use of water, micro-irrigation, reuse of waste water, desalination, aquifer recharge etc. It will be sharing these with India based on the
MOU. So, 1 is wrong.
It will help India in understanding in-situ water conservation techniques. It does not deal with territorial rights over water resources. So, 2 is also wrong.
