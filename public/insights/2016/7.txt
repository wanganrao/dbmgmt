1 Recently organizations representing the global shipping and oil industry revised the Piracy High Risk Area (HRa) and shifted its eastern boundary away from the western coastline of India to 65° East longitude. What implications will it have?
1.  Payment of Additional War Risk Premium (AWRP) over the extended HRA,which added to the cost of transportation in trade, will be removed.
2.  The shipping traffic would move slightly away from the Indian coast which will help avoid security related incidents of firing on boats.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
India had been seeking revision of the HRA back to 65 degree East longitude as continuation of the extended HRA had both economic and security implications. Payment of Additional War Risk Premium (AWRP) over the extended HRA added to the cost of transportation. So, 1 is correct.
The shipping traffic had moved closer to the Indian coast and the heightened alert had resulted in unfortunate incidents of firing on Indian fishing boats mistaken as pirate skiffs. Since the line is revised, 2 will be correct.
Revision of the HRA will ensure an optimal utilisation of international resources to combat maritime piracy by focusing international efforts on the actual areas of high-risk, it said.
Containment of maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia is an example of successful international collaboration in the area of maritime security.

16 As industrial societies progress, there is considerable specialization of labour. Which of the following is a pre-requisite for the specialization of labour?
a)  Efficient and effective division of labour
b)  Positive marginal product of labour
c)  High turnover of labour
d)  Labour Force Participation Rate reaches unity
Answer: A
Positive marginal product of labour means each extra labour added to the production process yields positive output. There may or may not be specialization of labour here. So, (b) is wrong.
High turnover of labour is not related with the specialization of labour. It may comes even via the use of machines, capital goods etc. So, (c) is wrong.
Labour Force Participation Rate reaches unity means all eligible people search for work or get work in the society. There may still be considerable diffusion of work responsibilities, for e.g. in agriculture in rural India. So, (d) is wrong.
Division of labour is the specialisation of work tasks, by means of which different occupations are combined within a production system. All societies have at least some rudimentary form of division of labour especially between the tasks allocated to men and those performed by women.
With the development of industrialism, however, the division of labour became
more complex than in any prior type of production system. In the modern world, the division of labour is international in scope

b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3

b)  Several guidelines issued by the Department of Personnel and Training
c)  A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between a Minister and bureaucrat

This principle comes from bureaucratic conventions, code of conducts of civil servants and to an extent the informal code of ethics. So, all options (a), (b), (c) are wrong.

21 A country is likely to have multiple time zones if

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  2, 3 and 4 only
Answer: A
 If a nation is spread on a large geographical area latitudinally, the Sun
will be at different positions in the sky for different latitudes on the nation at the same time. So, there is a possibility of having multiple time zones. For e.g. in Russia, there are about 11 time zones. So, 1 is correct.
The same cannot be said for longitude as it does not concern with the movement of the Sun or daylight. So, 2 is incorrect.
By the same logic as given in statement 1, both 3 and 4 will be incorrect.

Article 243A of the Constitution (Seventy-second) Amendment Bill, as introduced in the House, proposed that a Gram Sabha may exercise such powers at the village level as the Legislature of a State may, by law, provide. So, while GS is constituted by the Constitution, only powers are given by the state legislature.
So, (d) will be correct, and (c) will be wrong.

a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The Governor usually reserves such bills for the President who then either approves the bill or vetoes it or sends it back to the assembly. This is to ensure harmony between the central laws, state laws and the constitution. So, 1 is correct.
The RS does not has such powers over state bills even though it represents the states. So, 2 is incorrect.

28 Peninsular rivers are characterised by absence of meanders because
1.  These rivers do not have capacity for lateral erosion of banks.
2.  There rivers pass through hard rocky terrain.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Any rivers that flow at a considerable speed can erode both lateral banks as well as river bed. So, 1 is wrong as peninsular rivers flow at fast speeds. When they slow down, lateral bank cutting is predominant.
However, this erosion can take place only when the bank is soft or river bed is made of erodible soft rocks. Since, peninsular blocks are hard, rocky, old and
consolidated, little silt is accumulated by these rivers. So, 2 is correct.

a)  Reforms in the Civil Services Institutions
b)  Reforms in the Local bodies
c)  Reforms in the Governance of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)
d)  An overhaul of the regulatory architecture of the Union government
Answer: B
 The Manishankar Aiyer committee was setup to show the way forward. It recommended the following:
Panchayats should be allowed to raise their own resources through collection of taxes.
Panchayat heads and members should get training in accounts and audit, besides governance.
Panchayats should have effective control over their employees( deputed to them by the state) though payment control
A single ministry should be constituted to look after both Panchayats and municipalities
An ombudsman should be setup for Panchayats for all states.
As per the committee, complete and effective operationalizing of the panchayati raj system has been hobbled mainly by "a lack of clarity as to how to proceed scientifically, objectively, methodically and practically down the path" of devolution.

34 While entering the plains, Himalayan Rivers generally make which of the following patterns?
1.  Braided channels
2.  Flat valleys
3.  Indented Coastlines
4.  Ox-bow lakes
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 4 only
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Braided channels occur in rivers with high slope when, threshold level of sediment load or slope is reached, any slope over this threshold
creates a braided stream. This is true for Himalayan Rivers and so 1 is correct.
Statement 2: Flat valleys, like V-shaped valleys, are formed by streams, but they are no longer in their youthful stage, and are instead considered mature. With these streams, as the slope of a stream's channel becomes smooth, and begins to exit the steep V or U-shaped valley, the valley floor gets wider. Because the stream gradient is moderate or low, the river begins to erode the bank of its channel instead of valley walls. So, 2 is correct as it is found in Himalayan rivers.
Statement 4: An oxbow is a crescent-shaped lake lying alongside a winding river. The oxbow lake is created over time as erosion and deposits of soil change the river's course. This is found in bank eroding Himalayan Rivers. So, 4 is correct.

35 Which of the following bodies was entirely nominated by the British?
a)  Constituent Assembly, 1946
b)  Drafting Committee of the Constitution
c)  First Interim Cabinet of India after formation of constitution
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Constituent Assembly, 1946 was partly nominated, partly elected. So you can easily eliminate. Option (a) is wrong.
Drafting Committee of the Constitution was appointed by the assembly and the leaders. So, (b) is wrong.
First Interim Cabinet of India after formation of constitution was formed based on election results and party politics. So, (c) is wrong.
Thus, (d) will be the only answer.

36 The southwest monsoon first arrives India at the
a)  Odisha Coast
b)  TamilNadu and Andhra Pradesh Coasts
c)  Kerala Coast
d)  Maharashtra Coast
Answer: C
 As a result of rapid increase of temperature in May over the north- western plains, the low pressure conditions over there get further intensified. By early June, they are powerful enough to attract the trade winds of Southern Hemisphere coming from the Indian Ocean.
These southeast trade winds cross the equator and enter the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, only to be caught up in the air circulation over India. Passing over the equatorial warm currents, they bring with them moisture in abundance.
After crossing the equator, they follow a south-westerly direction. That is why they are known as southwest monsoons.

38 The District Planning Committee is a
a)  Constitutional authority expected to consolidate development plans made by
Rural and urban local governments.
b)  Statutory authority expected to assist the State Planning Departments in assessing the resources of particular districts
c)  An executive authority expected to help the panchayats in the implementation of social welfare schemes
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
It is a constitutional authority expected to frame development plans under Article 243ZD and consolidate plans made by Rural and urban local governments.
4/5th of total members at least to be elected by, and from amongst, the members of the panchayats + right proportion of municipality and villages + rest 1/5th experts, specialists, govt. representatives can be included
State legislatures determine - chairperson of DPC, other parameters
 Issues with DPCs:
Only half the states have functioning DPCs
State planning board guidelines not followed e.g. in Rajasthan
Do not have powers to modify or change existing plans or budget or projects
- can only offer suggestions - ultimate decision local body
Most programmes implemented in isolation from DPCs (without seeking advice) like by DRDA, panchayats etc.
Can not match the technical sophistication or planners, engineers and economists like central or state planning boards - due to lack of skilled personnel at district level
State FCs have rarely recommended funds for district plans + no provision in state budgets also
Most district plans are a mere summation of ULBs and RLBs plans and not a synergistic integration.
Tied funds given by centre - now flexi-funds given only to the State Planning departments
MPLAD and MLA spending is not integrated with the district plans.

41 which of the following correctly differentiate(s) between Non-Resident Indian (NRI)
and an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)?
1.  OCI is a kind of dual citizenship in India, but NRI is not.
2.  NRIs enjoy the right to vote, but OCIs do not.
3.  OCIs have to obtain a visa every time they visit India, which is not the case with
NRIs.
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
 This will clarify the differences between NRIs vs PIOs vs
OCI. Recently PIO and OCI categories have been nearly merged.
AÿNon-Resident Indianÿ(NRI) is aÿcitizen of Indiaÿwho holds an
Indianÿpassportÿand has temporarilyÿemigratedÿto another country for six
months
or more for employment, residence, education or any other purpose. AÿPerson of Indian Originÿ(PIO) is a person of Indian origin or ancestry but
who is not a citizen of India and is the citizen of another country (except South Asian countries). A PIO might have been a citizen of India and subsequently taken the citizenship of another country, or have ancestors born in India or other states.
A Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) is a PIO who had migrated to other countries and acquired citizenship (except Afghanistan and Bangladesh) there. If their country of residence allows dual citizenship they are eligible to hold a OCI card.
Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of India and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality.
An Overseas Citizen of India will enjoy all rights and privileges available toÿNon-Resident Indiansÿon a parity basis excluding the right to invest in agriculture and plantation properties or hold public office, and the right to vote.
 It had been a hot topic for sometime last year and this year too and needed to be covered.

45 Which of the following describes the selection of the Vice-President of India most appropriately?
a)  Based on the discretion of the President of India
b)  Based on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet agreed to by the Prime
Minister of India
c)  Based on the votes garnered by the Leader of Oppositions of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
d)  Based on voting by a collegium of the Parliament

FRs contain certain values like value of human life and dignity, values against
exploitation, values of equality, secularism etc. So, 4 is correct.

47 India attaches a lot of importance to its Act East Policy given the region's international and domestic significance. However, Look West Policy is also significant for us because
1.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is our largest trading partner.
2.  Our main air corridors and sea lanes for our connectivity with Europe and North
America lie through this area. Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: As a single trading partner, GCC is our largest partner, with almost $160 billion trade. If we take into account our trade with two other countries in the Gulf region, Iraq ($21.5 billion) and Iran ($15 billion) the trade with the region becomes $195 billion.
Additionally we get $30 billion annually as remittances from the GCC countries. Add all this up and our economic relationship with the region becomes $225 billion. This is more than the combined trade with ASEAN and China; or entire EU and US.
Statement 2: Straits of Malacca may be important for our trade with China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan but about 50% of our trade has to use the Straits of Hormuz, Bab el Mandeb the narrow entrance to the red Sea, Suez Canal and the Straits of Gibraltar, all located in this region. Air flights to Europe and North America must use air corridors through this area for cost effectiveness.

48 South-west Monsoon upto/in India is/are guided by
1.  Trade Winds
2.  Western Disturbances
3.  Low pressure trough created over India
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1 and 3
Answer: D
As a result of rapid increase of temperature in May over the north- western plains, the low pressure conditions over there get further intensified. By early June, they are powerful enough to attract the trade winds of Southern Hemisphere coming from the Indian Ocean. So, 1 and 3 are correct.
These southeast trade winds cross the equator and enter the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, only to be caught up in the air circulation over India. Passing over the equatorial warm currents, they bring with them moisture in abundance.
Western Disturbances withdraw when Monsoons come in India. However, the tropical cyclonic depressions formed in
Bay of Bengal affect the direction and intensity of Monsoons in India. So, 3 is incorrect.

49 Why is having a written constitution important for a polity like India?
1.  A democratic polity cannot be run without a written constitution.
2.  A written constitution reduces the chances of disputes between the different organs of the polity.
3.  A written constitution is essential to a federal polity.
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
Statement 1: It can be. Britain does not have a written constitution.
Statement 2 & 3: A written constitution is actually more important when there are several tiers of government, and where all tiers are supposed to be semi-autonomous from each other. It reduces the chance of conflicts between them and ensures a smooth functioning of federal polity.

50 Winter monsoons do not generally cause rainfall in India as
1.  The monsoon winds move from land to sea.
2.  They do not have the support of Western cyclonic disturbances.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Winter monsoons do not cause rainfall as they move from land to the sea. It is because firstly, they have little humidity; and secondly, due to anti cyclonic circulation on land, the possibility of rainfall from them reduces.
Western cyclonic disturbances are 'cyclonic' and not 'anti-cyclonic'. So, 1 is correct, but 2 is incorrect. As you will see below, Western disturbances actually help to bring rainfall.
So, most parts of India do not have rainfall in the winter season.
 However, there are some exceptions to it:
In north-western India, some weak temperate cyclones from the Mediterranean Sea cause rainfall in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh.
Central parts of India and northern parts of southern Peninsula also get winter rainfall occasionally.
Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in the northeastern parts of India also have rains between 25 mm and 50 mm during these winter months.
During October and November, northeast monsoon while crossing over the
Bay of Bengal, picks up moisture and causes torrential rainfall over the Tamil
Nadu coast, southern Andhra Pradesh, southeast Karnataka and southeast
Kerala.

51 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted from 2015 do NOT deal with?
1.  Education for all
2.  Reduced inequalities among citizens
3.  Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  They deal with all of the above
Answer: D
 SDGs consist of 17 goals and 169 targets in contrast to 8 goals and 18 targets in MDGs set to expire in 2015.
It will apply to all UN member states and not just those in the developing world. In this way, we hope they will become as "universal" as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights-a vital element of the civic armoury in the fight for fairness.
Goals are related to ending poverty; sustainable development; universal enrolment; improving implementation etc. These goals are similar to MDGs, while others like reducing inequality are new to SDGs.
 What is required for SDGs success?
MDGs success, in part, lie in China reducing poverty by nearly 30% since the beginning of MDG in 2000. Similarly, experts opine, India's performance
will be crucial to the success of SDGs.
As per WB President, one state, UP, in India houses 8% of world's BPL
population. UP's progress will push SDGs success.
Instead of top-down approach in implementation of SDGs, bottom-up approach is needed. Hence, state and local governments in participation with civil society (NGOs, think tanks, social activists) will achieve greater progress than Central government alone can do.
NITI Aayog, India, can play a crucial role in monitoring SDGs progress.
Ministries and departments can align social welfare scheme with SDGs. This
will lessen the administrative burden of implementation of SDGs.

52 The power of Judicial Review and independence of Judiciary in the Indian constitution had been
a)  An indigenous idea given by the Political affairs committee of the constitution
b)  For long in the mind of Nationalists and public alike
c)  Generated in the course of the Civil Disobedience Movement, 1930s
d)  Borrowed from the USA constitution and improvised
Answer: D
 It comes from the American constitution. However, we have not adopted the 'due process of law' and went for the 'procedure established by law' in handling Judicial review.
The former means that the Judiciary can review laws even based on reasonableness. In the latter, the Judiciary only checks whether due process was followed in enacting a law.
However, in India, the lines between the two have blurred over the years especially since the Kesavananda Bharati case 1973. Therefore, we see both in play today, which is often called as Judicial activism.

53 The rivers originating from the Amarkantak range present a good example of
a)  Dendritic Drainage pattern
b)  Radial Drainage pattern
c)  Trellis Drainage pattern
d)  Centripetal Drainage pattern
Answer: B
 When the rivers originate from a hill and flow in all directions, the drainage pattern is known as 'radial'. This can be seen in the Amarkantak range. So, (b) is correct.
 The drainage pattern resembling the branches of a tree is known as
"dendritic" the examples of which are the rivers of northern plain.
When the primary tributaries of rivers flow parallel to each other and secondary tributaries join them at right angles, the pattern is known as 'trellis'.
(When the rivers discharge their waters from all directions in a lake or depression, the pattern is known as 'centripetal'.

54 Why are the western coastal plains devoid of any delta?
1.  Coasts are shallow.
2.  The plains are indented.
3.  They are a region of high tectonic activity.
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 The Rivers that originate in Western Ghats flow eastwards or westwards.
The west flowing rivers are shorter than the east flowing rivers. There is a high gradient for the west flowing rivers than the east flowing rivers.
More gradient means higher is the velocity of the river. Therefore West flowing rivers end up forming estuaries rather than deltas.
Moreover, the rocks are hard to erode which means less silt and little delta formation at sea mouth.
None of the reasons 1, 2 or 3 addresses these reasons. Even when coasts are shallow
or indented or of high tectonic activity, deltas can be formed.

55 Consider the following about the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
1.  It related to the Kyoto Protocol.
2.  Only industrialized countries can participate in it.
3.  Certified emission reduction (CER) credits are associated with CDM.
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
 The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), defined in Article 12 of the Protocol, allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party) to implement an emission- reduction project in developing countries. Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets.
A CDM project activity might involve, for example, a rural electrification project using solar panels or the installation of more energy-efficient boilers. The CDM allows industrialized countries to buy CERs and to invest in emission reductions where it is cheapest globally. The CDM is designed to start off developing countries on a path towards less pollution, with industrialised (Annex B) countries paying for these reductions.

57 Which institution in India acts as the Debt Manager of the Government of India?
a)  Reserve Bank of India
b)  Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
c)  Investment Management Company (IMCO)
d)  Export - Import Bank of India (Exim)
Answer: A
 There was a recent proposal to set up a new Public Debt management agency (PDMa). Before this, the jurisdiction of various institutions responsible for
public debt management is given below:
I. II. III.
Reserve Bank of India - Domestic Marketable Debt i.e., dated securities, treasury bills and cash management bills.
Ministry of Finance (MOF); Office of Aid and accounts Division - external debt
Ministry of Finance; Budget Division and Reserve Bank of India - Other liabilities such as small savings, deposits, reserve funds etc.For monetary and fiscal coordination, there is a cash and debt management committee which
meets regularly. The members comprise of officials from RBI and MOF.
 In India, RBI is both Central banker and Debt management agency
(Treasury)
The proposal to setup a PDMA was based on some inherent Conflict of interests that
RBI faces:
By issuing bonds (in OMOs) at low interest rates, it can reduce government debt, but since interest rates are low, few will buy bonds and excess liquidity will cause inflation. On the other hand, interest rate should be raised to fight inflation. Thus, there is a conflict.
Financial repression and borrowing - For e.g. RBI is the regulator of all bank in India. Govt. raises debt from SLR obligations of banks, the limit for which is mandated by RBI. SLR does not give high returns, but risk-free stable returns. Since RBI is also the debt manager, there is a conflict of interest as RBI may service govt. debt by forcing banks to hold higher SLR.
Inflation reduces the real debt of government. As RBI is the debt manager, there is a conflict of interest, in reducing real debt of govt. and cutting down in inflation.

2.  Enforce a statutory Right
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
A writ means an order. A warrant is also a type of writ. Anything that is issued under an authority is a writ.
In this sense, using the power conferred by Article 32 and 226, the Supreme Court and High courts issue directions, orders or writs.
Where SC can issue writs only for enforcing fundamental rights, HCs can also use it to enforce a legal right, for e.g. right to property.

59 Floods destroy valuable crops every year and damage physical infrastructure. However, floods are also helpful in which of the following way(s)?
1.  Recharge of groundwater aquifiers
2.  Deposition of fertile silt
3.  Rejuvenation of the river ecosystem
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Statement 2 and 3: Every year, floods deposit fertile silt over
agricultural fields which are good for the crops. Majuli (Assam), the largest riverine island in the world, is the best example of good paddy crops after the annual floods in Brahmaputra.
They also help in nutrient mixing of water, cleaning up wastes etc.
Statement 1: Flood water also seeps to the ground and recharges the underground aquifiers.

60 Gold bond scheme allows investors to invest in sovereign bonds linked directly to price of gold and will be paid off a market determined nominal interest rate. How will the scheme help Indian economy?
1.  Help reduce Current Account Deficit (CAD)
2.  Allow government to channelize greater domestic savings to capital formation
3.  Stabilize the price of Gold in international markets reducing vulnerability in India
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  2 only
Answer: A
Gold forms a large part of our imports. The scheme is likely to reduce demand for physical gold. So, 1 is correct.
Gold means unproductive idle savings. If the same is mobilized in formal financial institutions, it can be used for infrastructural development. So, 2 is correct.
Statement 3 is far-fetched, as the scheme may oy may not stabilize international prices of gold, which further depends on a variety of factors like global growth rate, speculative forces etc.

61 The Human Development Index takes into account which of the following factors in its calculation?
1.  Rate of school drop outs
2.  Sanitation and drinking water provisions
3.  Adult literacy rate
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  3 only
Answer: D
 The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.
A country scores higher HDI when the life expectancy at birth is longer, the education period is longer, and the income per capita is higher. It includes:
Life Expectancy Index (LEI)
Education Index (EI) which includes Mean Years of Schooling Index (MYSI)
and Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI) Income Index (II)
The fact that HDI does not consider school dropout rates is considered a prime drawback, which is very prevalent in developing countries like India. So, the years of schooling would not reflect the education levels if the child has dropped out.

62 Which of the following fundamental rights is NOT available to linguistic minorities in
India?
a)  Right to Inheritance of Ancestral property
b)  Right to preservation of cultural heritage
c)  Right to adopt, practice and propagate a religious belief

64 Decisions of which of the following authorities may be binding on the Council of
Ministers?
1.  Supreme Court and High Courts
2.  Vice-President of India acting in his capacity
3.  Union Public Service Commission
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
 Supreme Court and High Courts pass binding judgements, e.g. SR Bommai Case, DC Wadhwa Case, issue writs etc. So, 1 is correct.
Vice-President of India acting in his capacity does not have any de facto authority. Only if he acts as the President, some of his decisions, for e.g. veto powers over bills may be binding. So, 2 is incorrect.
Union Public Service Commission is an advisory body to the GoI. So, 3 is incorrect.

65 The laissez-fairez theory aims to promote
a)  Expansion of production with high productivity as a key objective
b)  High exports and low imports
c)  Free trade and free play of market forces
d)  Development of a centrally planned economic system
Answer: C
 French for 'leave alone', laissez-faire is an economic theory that became
popular in the 18th century. The driving idea behind laissez-faire as a theory was that the less the government is involved in free market capitalism, the better off business will be, and then by extension society as a whole.
The underlying beliefs that make up the fundamentals of of laissez-faire economics include first and foremost that the natural world is a self-regulating system, and that natural regulation is the best type of regulation. Laissez-faire economists argue that because of this there is no need for the complicating involvement of government.
Government involvement, according to this economic theory, would include any type of regulation, minimum wage, taxation, or oversight. Laissez-faire economists see taxation on companies as a penalty for production.

66 While the sun rises in the northeastern states about two hours earlier as compared to
Jaisalmer, the watches in Jaisalmer show the same time as in the NE states. Why?
1.  We follow a standard time for the entire nation.
2.  While NE states follow daylight saving, other states do not.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 We do not follow daylight saving. So, 2 is wrong.
Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of setting the clocks forward one hour from Standard Time during the summer months, and back again in the fall, in order to make better use of natural daylight.
You can go through this article to understand what the demand for introducing daylight saving in India was.

67 What do you understand by the often used term "Cooperative Federalism"?
a)  A healthy competition amongst the states of India for growth and b)  Constitutional division of powers between Centre and States
c)  Centre and states working jointly to resolve issues of public interest
d)  An ideal of federalism where states are given complete autonomy from the Centre
Answer: C
 Cooperative federalism is a concept of federalism in which national, state, and local governments interact cooperatively and collectively to solve common problems, rather than making policies separately.
Other elements are:
Principle of subsidiarity - Responsibility for managing state/local specific schemes/services etc should be shifted where it rightfully belongs, that is, State and local levels.
Sharing of powers and responsibilities between the three levels of government which involves participative policymaking.
Requisites for ensuring cooperative federalism are:
Greater devolution of financial resources towards the States. Respect for the mandate of elected governments, even those run by opposition parties.
These should be complemented by competitive federalism. States would vie with each other to attract investments and provide better public goods and services.
Reports

68 The "Principle of Subsidiarity" with respect to the relations between State governments and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) mean
a)  The State governments should not try to control the ULBs.
b)  The State governments should allow the ULBs to impose and collect taxes
c)  The ULBs should work in cooperation with the other ULBs of the state even outside their jurisdiction
d)  Responsibility and powers should be devolved to the level where it rightfully belongs and is most efficient
Answer: D
 Principle of Subsidiarity is a 'core principle' of Local government as per 2nd ARC.
It means what can be done best at the lower levels of government should not be centalised at higher levels like cyber security; national defence etc. Its benefits are:
Leads to efficiency, innovation, competition and self-reliance
Makes Indian democracy fully legitimate by making its truly devolved and participatory
Citizenry will become more responsible and enlightened as they will appreciate the hard choices that are to be made in governance. Leads to maturing of democracy.

b)  Mizo Hills
c)  Patkai Range
d)  Jampui Hills
Answer: B
 The range is part of the Patkai range system The hills are for the most part covered with dense bamboo jungle and rank undergrowth; but in the eastern portion, owing probably to a smaller rainfall, open grass-covered slopes are found, with groves of oak and pine interspersed with rhododendrons. The Blue Mountain is the highest peak in Lushai hills.
These hills are inhabited by the Lushais and other Mizo tribes, but the population is extremely scanty.
The management of the South Lushai hill country was transferred from Bengal to
Assam in 1898.

73 Which of the following form a major water divide between the Arabian Sea Drainage and Bay of Bengal Drainage in India?
a)  Delhi Ridge
b)  Aravalis
c)  Sahyadris
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Indian drainage system may be divided on various bases. On the basis of discharge of water (orientations to the sea), it may be grouped into:
(i) the Arabian Sea drainage; and (ii) the Bay of Bengal drainage.
They are separated from each other through the Delhi ridge, the Aravalis and the Sahyadris. Nearly 77 per cent of the drainage area consisting of the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, the Mahanadi, the Krishna, etc. is oriented towards the Bay of Bengal while 23 per cent comprising the Indus, the Narmada, the Tapi, the Mahi and the Periyar systems discharge their waters in the Arabian Sea.

74 Consider the following statements.

 Western Ghats are comparatively higher in elevation and more continuous than the Eastern Ghats. Their average elevation is about 1,500 m with the height increasing from north to south.
'Anaimudi' (2,695 m), the highest peak of Peninsular plateau is located on the Anaimalai hills of the Western Ghats followed by Dodabetta (2,637 m) on the Nilgiri hills.
Eastern Ghats comprising the discontinuous and low hills are highly eroded by the rivers such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna, the Kaveri, etc. Some of the important ranges include the Javadi hills, the Palconda range, the Nallamala hills,
the Mahendragiri hills, etc. The Eastern and the Western Ghats meet each other at the Nilgiri hills.

75 The "Nitaqat Law" of Saudi Arabia was in news some time ago. It was related to
a)  Deportation of unorganized Indian national labour from Saudi
b)  Holding back property rights from Indian nationals living in Saudi
c)  Debarring Indian nationals to hold public offices in Saudi
d)  Give greater statutory preference to local Saudis in employment in firms
Answer: D
 In 2013, the government in Saudi decided to give more preference to locals in jobs. For this purpose, it made the employment of 10% locals mandatory in all firms. The Indians who were already working in these firms had to move out. This created a big crisis as around 1 million workers were to be expatriated back to
India.
The Indian government negotiated gradual implementation of the law so that the workers get enough time to settle themselves. It also launched Pravasi bima yojana, a scheme that helps them build their savings.

76 As compared to the western coastal plain, the eastern coastal plain is broader and is an example of an emergent coast. But, the eastern coastal plain has less number of ports and harbours than the western side. Why?
1.  The continental shelf extends far into the sea.
2.  The eastern coastal plains are tectonically unstable.
3.  The eastern coastal plains suffer from large inter-tidal variations that make it difficult for ships to be stranded in the open sea.
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Since the continental shelf extends far into the sea, the coastlines are not very deep that can support standing cargo ships. So, 1 is correct.
There are a number of ports on the eastern coasts. Therefore, whether tectonically stable or unstable is not a reason for establishing ports. 2 is wrong.
Inter-tidal variations are actually good for ships as during high tide, it is easier for ships to get stranded at the coast. So, 3 is incorrect.
 Western submergence of Peninsula it is a narrow belt and provides natural conditions for the development of ports and harbours. Kandla, Mazagaon, JLN port Navha Sheva, Marmagao, Mangalore, Cochin, etc. are some of the important natural ports located along the west coast.

Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1, 2 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: A
 Statements 1 and 2 are correct as the President can exercise these powers without the aid and advice of the council of ministers.
Statement 3 is incorrect as the President is not free to appoint anyone as the Pm, but only the leader of the majority party/coalition.
Statement 4 is correct as it is the President's obligation to maintain political order in our Parliamentary democracy. To ensure this, he must dissolve the Lok Sabha when it fails to represent the will of the people.

79 What does the term "encryption" mean in the context of cyber security?
a)  It is a process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it.
b)  It is the practice of restricting access to internet content based upon the user's geographical location.
c)  It relates to the exchange of information on a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
 Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it.
For example: word "ABC" can become "BCD" in encrypted form, if every letter is replaced by next alphabet. Those who know how it is encoded can only able to read "ABC" correctly.
All messaging services like WhatsApp, Viber, Google Chat, Yahoo messenger use encrypted services. Banks (payment gateways) and e-commerce sites also use encryption to protect financial and private data including passwords.
Under Section 84A of Information Technology Act, 2000 Rules are to be framed to prescribe modes or methods for encryption
The Government of India recently published the Draft National Encryption policy for public comments

80 Which of the following is most appropriately related to the often used term "Judicial
Activism"?
a)  When the Judiciary declares that it wields executive and legislative powers
b)  When the Judiciary declares void an executive order that impinges on public interest
c)  When the Judiciary exercises self-restraint principle and is passive in interpretation of laws
d)  When the Judiciary disregards Parliamentary laws and executive rules
Answer: B
 Judicial Activism is one step ahead of judicial review - an extension of judicial review. It is when the Judiciary takes upon those issues that are normally left to be dealt by the legislature or the executive for e.g. the judgement on transgenders, on police reforms in 2006. The personal views of the judges, rather than existing laws, may also guide the decisions.
It is a departure of the Judiciary from the self-restraint principle and passive interpretation of law to an active social engineer and law upholder. It stems from the broader interpretation of existing statues and FRs.
The Supreme Court has ordered to set up a special 'Social Justice Bench' to exclusively hear cases concerning social issues by way of PIL. The issues would range from women safety to mid-day meals in schools and night shelters for the under privileged.

81 Which of the following differentiates the evolution of the Himalayan Drainage pattern from that of the Peninsular?
1.  Peninsular river system is older than the Himalayan river system.
2.  Upheaval of Himalayas affected the Himalayan river system, but not the peninsular river system.
3.  Peninsular river system was deformed due to subsidence of the western flank of the
Indian Peninsula, but this developed Himalayan Rivers. Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
  These points explain the differences between both in order:
a)  Himalayan river system is believed to have originated from a mighty river called Indo-Brahma in the Miocene period.
Peninsular system is older than the Himalayan river
b)  Himalayan is dismembered in three groups - Indus system, Ganges and
Brahmaputra and tributaries of each.
Peninsular did not dismember, but subsidence of the western flank of the Peninsula leading to its submergence below the sea disturbed the symmetrical plan of the river system.
c)  Dismemberment between Indus system and Ganges was caused by upheaval in western Himalayas (Pleistocene age) and upliftment of Potwar plateau (Delhi ridge).
Upheaval of Himalayas led to trough faulting (and not dismemberment) in Peninsula. Today Narmada and Tapti flow in the trough faults.
d)  Down-thrusting of the Malda gap area between the Rajmahal hills and the Meghalaya plateau (Pleistocene period), diverted the Ganges and the Brahmaputra systems to flow towards the Bay of Bengal.
This down-thrusting did not affect the flow of Peninsular rivers towards Bay of Bengal. But, slight tilting of the Peninsular block from northwest to the South-eastern direction gave orientation to the entire
drainage system towards the Bay of Bengal.

82 The Indus receives a number of Himalayan tributaries which include
1.  Gilgit
2.  Nubra
3.  Zaskar
4.  Shigar
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 4 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
 The Indus receives a number of Himalayan tributaries such as the Shyok, the Gilgit, the Zaskar, the Hunza, the Nubra, the Shigar, the Gasting and the Dras. It finally emerges out of the hills near Attock where it receives the Kabul river on its right bank.
The other important tributaries joining the right bank of the Indus are the Khurram, the Tochi, the Gomal, the Viboa and the Sangar. They all originate in the Sulaiman ranges. The river flows southward and receives 'Panjnad' a little above Mithankot.
The Panjnad is the name given to the five rivers of Punjab, namely the Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum. It finally discharges into the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi. The Indus flows in India only through the Leh district in Jammu and Kashmir.

83 The elections to the Rajya Sabha is based on
a)  Mixed Member Proportional system
b)  Alternative Vote/Instant-runoff voting
c)  Majority Bonus System
d)  Single Transferable Vote system
Answer: D
 The Single Transferable Vote system (STV) is a variant of the PR
system.
It is followed for Rajya Sabha elections. Every State has a specific quota of seats in the Rajya Sabha. The members are elected by the respective State legislative assemblies. The voters are the MLAs in that State.
Every voter is required to rank candidates according to her or his preference. To be declared the winner, a candidate must secure a minimum quota of votes

84 The Brahmaputra is well-known for floods, channel shifting and bank erosion. Which of the following can explain it?
1.  Brahmaputra's river bed has zero seepage capacity.
2.  Large quantity of sediments brought by its tributaries increase the water level.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 This is due to the fact that most of its tributaries are large, and bring large quantity of sediments owing to heavy rainfall in its catchment area.
This increases the water level and cause heavy floods in regions like Assam. So, 2 is correct.
A river bed will always have some seepage capacity, meaning that water will seep down from the river bed to groundwater in case of excess discharge. It helps control flood water. So, 1 is incorrect.

85 The President can be removed from office by a process of impeachment for
a)  Not following the advice of the Vice-President
b)  Violation of the Constitution
c)  Approving decisions that impinge on public interest
d)  Speaking against the Council of Ministers
Answer: B
 The President can be removed from office only by Parliament by following the procedure for impeachment.
This procedure requires a special majority as explained in the last chapter.
The only ground for impeachment is violation of the Constitution. However, the phrase has not been defined in the constitution.
For e.g. if the council of ministers tenders an unconstitutional advice to President and if he signs it, whether it is violation of the constitution or not? This is because not following the advice of the CoM is also a violation of the constitution.

86 There is a lack of alluvial and deltaic deposits in Narmada and Tapi rivers because
a)  They do not erode the river bed.
b)  They flow in trough faults and fill the original cracks with their detritus materials.
c)  Their sediments are ploughed back by distributaries.
d)  They make large estuaries and lagoons away from the coast.
Answer: B
 The Narmada and The Tapi flow in trough faults and fill the original cracks with their detritus materials. Hence, there is a lack of alluvial and deltaic deposits in these rivers. So, (b) is correct.
The Damodar, which occupies the eastern margins of the Chotanagpur Plateau, also flows through a rift valley.

87 The physiography or relief of India affects which of the following climatic variables?
1.  Temperature
2.  Air pressure
3.  Direction and speed of wind
4.  Amount and distribution of rainfall
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 and 4 only
b)  2 only
c)  1, 3 and 4
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
 Himalayas is one classic example. So, 1 would be correct.
Mountainous areas have low air pressure. So, 2 is correct.
Mountains like Western Ghats change the direction and speed of moisture laden winds. So, 3 is correct.
The windward sides of Western Ghats and Assam receive high rainfall than the adjoining leeward sides. So, 4 is also correct.

88 Consider the following about the mechanism of Weather changes in the Summer Season in India.
1.  The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts southwards.
2.  Westerly jet stream withdraws from the Indian region.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 As the summer sets in and the sun shifts northwards, the wind circulation over the subcontinent undergoes a complete reversal at both, the lower as well as the upper levels.
By the middle of July, the low pressure belt nearer the surface [termed as Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)] shifts northwards, roughly parallel to the Himalayas between 20° N and 25° N with the apparent movement of the Sun. So, 1 is incorrect.
Also, by this time, the westerly jet stream withdraws from the Indian region. So, 2 is correct.
 In fact, meteorologists have found an interrelationship between the northward shift of the equatorial trough (ITCZ) and the withdrawal of the westerly jet stream from over the North Indian Plain. It is generally believed that there is a cause and effect relationship between the two.
The ITCZ being a zone of low pressure, attracts inflow of winds from different
directions. The maritime tropical airmass (mT) from the southern hemisphere, after crossing the equator, rushes to the low pressure area in the general southwesterly direction. It is this moist air current which is popularly known as the southwest monsoon.

89 Consider the following about the Law Commission of India.
1.  It is a statutory body.
2.  It acts as the legal representative of the Government in court hearings
3.  The Law Secretary to the Union Government is the ex-officio member of the
Commission.
Select the correct answer using the codes below:
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1 and 2 only
Answer: C
 Law commission of India is neither a constitutional nor a statutory body. Rather, it was established by an executive resolution of the GoI to make recommendations for law reforms. So, 1 would be wrong.
The Commission is established for a fixed tenure (generally three years) and consists of a Chairperson and four other full-time members. The Law Secy. and the Secy Legislative Department are the ex-officio members of the Commission. So, 3 would be correct.
It is the Attorney general or the Solicitor generals who represent Indian government in court hearings. So, 2 is wrong.

90 During the south-west monsoon period after heavy rains for a few days, if rain fails to occur for one or more weeks, it is known as break in the monsoon. These breaks in the different regions can be due to
1.  Wind blowing parallel to the coast in Western coastal areas.
2.  The appearance of the Western Tropical Cyclones from the Arabian Sea
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
  These breaks in rainfall are related to the cyclonic depressions mainly formed at the head of the Bay of Bengal, and their crossing into the mainland. Besides the frequency and intensity of these depressions, the passage followed by them determines the spatial distribution of rainfall.
Moreover, these breaks in the different regions are due to different reasons:
In northern India rains are likely to fail if the rain-bearing storms are not very frequent along the monsoon trough or the ITCZ over this region.
Over the west coast the dry spells are associated with days when winds blow parallel to the coast. So, 1 is correct.
2 is incorrect as Western Tropical Cyclones originate from the Mediterranean Sea, and they usually withdraw with the onset of the Monsoon.

91 The "Leader of opposition" in either house of Parliament is

92 Regulatory control over the quality, safety and efficacy of drugs in the country is exercised through
a)  Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
b)  The Pharmacy Act, 1948
c)  Indian Medical Council Act, 1956
d)  Indian Red Cross Society Act, 1920
Answer: A
 The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 is a Central Act implemented mainly through the States / UTs which have the major responsibilities to grant / renew the drugs manufacturing licenses and sale licenses and enforcement of various provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules including.
At present, the drug regulatory authorities of the States / UT Governments have grossly inadequate infrastructure and manpower.
Considering the sensitivity and importance of the Pharmaceutical Sector and lack of resources available with State / UT Governments, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme to strengthen their infrastructure, both physical and human resources, has been
envisaged during the 12th Five Year Plan.

93 Consider the following statements.
1.  Tropical cyclones only occur during Monsoon season in India.
2.  Tropical cyclones occur more in Arabian Sea than Bay of Bengal Sea.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 In the table below (taken from the Q Source), you can see that cyclones occur in nearly every month - more pronounced in Oct-Nov time.
The reason is that conditions exist throughout the months. So, 1 is incorrect. Tropical cyclones occur more in the Bay of Bengal Sea rather than Arabian Sea as
more favourable conditions exist there in form of higher temperatures, presence of
easterlies etc. So, 2 is incorrect.

94 What can possibly happen if the sun shines vertically above the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere?
a)  Low pressure develops over North-western India due to high temperatures.
b)  The ITCZ shifts north-westwards.
c)  It increases the probability of occurrence of El-nino and La-nina in India.
d)  High pressure develops over North-western India due to low temperatures.
Answer: D
 By the end of December, the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of
Capricorn in the southern hemisphere.
The weather in this season is characterised by feeble high pressure conditions over the northern plain. In south India, the air pressure is slightly lower.
As a result, winds start blowing from north-western high pressure zone to the low air pressure zone over the Indian Ocean in the south.

 Some of the elements of India's 'Connect Central Asia' policy as follow:
India will strengthen its strategic and security cooperation. India already has strategic partnerships in place with some Central Asian countries. In focus will be military training, joint research, counter-terrorism coordination and close consultations on Afghanistan.
India looks to Central Asia as a long term partner in energy, and natural resources. Central Asia possesses large cultivable tracts of land and it sees potential for India to cooperate in production of profitable crops with value addition.
The medical field is another area that offers huge potential for cooperation. India is ready to extend cooperation by setting up civil hospitals/clinics in Central Asia.
India would like to assist in the setting up of a Central Asian University in Bishkek that could come up as a centre of excellence to impart world class education in areas like Information Technology, management, philosophy and languages.
India is working on setting up a Central Asian e-network with its hub in
India, to deliver, tele-education and tele-medicine connectivity, linking all the five Central Asian States.
Indian companies can showcase its capability in the construction sector and build world class structures at competitive rates. Central Asian countries, especially Kazakhstan, have almost limitless reserves of iron ore and coal, as well as abundant cheap electricity. India can help set up several medium size steel rolling mills, producing its requirement of specific products.
As for land connectivity, India has reactivated the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). India & Central Asian nations need to join our efforts to discuss ways to bridge the missing links in the Corridor at the earliest and also work on other connecting spurs along the route.
Absence of a viable banking infrastructure in the region is a major barrier to trade and investment. Indian banks can expand their presence if they see a favourable policy environment.
