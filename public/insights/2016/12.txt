15 The origins of Anekantavada can be traced back to the teachings of Mahavira. Anekantavada means
a)  Human beings cross many lives in the universal flux.
b)  No single point of view is the complete truth.
c)  Principle of Karma binds all mortal beings.
d)  Multiple ways towards salvation lead to nowhere.
Answer: B
 Jains contrast all attempts to arrogantly proclaim the sole monopoly on truth with andhagajany?yah, which can be illustrated through the parable of the "blind men and an elephant". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.).
All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.
This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception (this is the Absolute Truth).
According to the Jains, only the Kevalisomniscient beingscan comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge. Consequently, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent absolute truth.

Sewage, detergents, heavy metal, hypersaline water, herbicides, and other waste products all negatively affect seagrass meadows. Human activity such as mining, trawling, dredging, land-reclamation, and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation which smothers seagrass and prevents light from reaching it.
Statement 2: Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths. As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period, they are highly prone to deaths due to entanglement.
Statement 3: The fact that they live in shallow waters puts them under great pressure from human activity, especially coastal pollution.
Other reasons: The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil. Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range, particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
Statement 1: Human blood stays in a very narrow pH range around
(7.35 - 7.45 ). Below or above this range means symptoms and disease. If blood pH moves to much below 6.8 or above 7.8, cells stop functioning and the patient dies. The ideal pH for blood is 7.4
Statement 2: The pH of saliva is usually between 6.5 - 7.5. After we chew and swallow food it then enters the upper portion of the stomach which has a pH between 4.0 - 6.5.

40 Krills are central to the survival of the marine life in Antarctica. Why?
a)  They prevent overconcentration of iron in the ocean beds
b)  They connect the marine food chain from phytoplanktons to larger marine animals and fishes
c)  They are a source of nutrition for the corals and seagrass
d)  They filter the ocean water keeping it healthy for other marine animals
Answer: B
They do not process iron in the ocean. Moreover, some concentration of iron in the ocean is good for phytoplankton growth on which the Krills feed. So, (a) would be wrong.
Krill are considered an important trophic level connection - near the bottom of the food chain - because they feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton, converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet. So, (b) is correct.
They are not consumed by seagrass and corals. So, (c) is wrong.
Krills filter out their food from the water, not the water itself. So, (d) is also wrong.

42 Consider the following statements in respect of a jet engine and a rocket.
1.  Both a jet engine and a rocket engine function by expelling hot gases opposite to the direction of desired acceleration.
2.  A rocket carries its own supply of oxygen for combustion.
3.  A jet engine requires oxygen from the atmosphere for combustion.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 A rocket carries both fuel (which may be solid or liquid) and oxygen in contrast to a jet engine. Therefore it does not suck in air from the front. It burns the fuel with the oxygen, and eject it at very high velocities backward. This momentum is used to both lift and propel the rocket. There are no wings for uplift. Any wings are for steering purposes.
A rocket is generally much more powerful and wasteful than a jet engine. Most airplanes cannot possibly climb vertically, while rockets are designed to do that. A jet airplane cannot function outside the atmosphere, but a rocket can since it carries its own fuel and oxygen.

d)  Finding out a distribution formula that measures the extent of both short and
long wavelengths from an underground source.
Answer: C
 The Nobel Prize in Physics 2015 was awarded jointly to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur
b) McDonald.
The sun was theorised to be powered by nuclear reactions in its core and these produced neutrino particles.
Measurements of solar neutrino types were not consistent with models of the Sun's interior that showed more neutrino production.
They demonstrated that the neutrinos from the Sun were not disappearing on their way to Earth and can change their mass becoming undetected. This resolved the sun neutrino problem.

47 Consider the following about the International Date Line.
1.  It is a straight line that connects North Pole and South Pole.
2.  It demarcates the change of one calendar day to the next.
3.  The line passes through the Indian Ocean.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
Statement 1: It is not a straight line. For parts of its length, the IDL
follows the meridian of 180' longitude, roughly down the middle of the Pacific
Ocean. To avoid crossing nations internally, the IDL deviates west around the US
Aleutian Islands, separating them from islands in the far east of Russia, and further south, it deviates east around various island nations in the Pacific such as Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and Tokelau.
Statement 2: A person who goes around the world from east to west (the same direction as Magellan's voyage) would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15' of longitude crossed, and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the IDL.
In contrast, a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15' of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the IDL. The IDL must therefore be observed in conjunction with the Earth's time zones: on crossing it in either direction, the calendar date is adjusted by one day.
Statement 3: It passes through the middle of the pacific ocean.

Option B: Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. The toxin is obtained by licking a gland on their arm, and the secretion is activated by mixing with saliva. Their toxic bite is a deterrent to predators, and the toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a form of protection for their infants.
Option C: Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either "Vulnerable" or "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List.

53 What is the difference between the CMYK and RGB colour modes that are used in graphic display and printing?
1.  RGB model is a colour additive model, whereas CMYK is a subtractive model.
2.  Image made in CMYK mode cannot be printed, whereas under RGB mode it can be printed.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 RGB stands for the colors red, green, and blue, the colors widely recognized in design fields as the primary colors. The RGB model is known as an additive model, where colors are added together to make up what we see on
the screen.
Basically, pixels on a television set or computer monitor create tiny pixels that, if viewed under a magnifying glass, are one of those three colors. Light is projected through them, blending the colors on the eye's retina to create the desired colors.
CMYK, on the other hand, stands for the colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. CMYK is a subtractive model. This gets a bit complicated, but the idea with subtractive models like CMYK is that colors from the spectrum are subtracted from natural white light into pigments or dyes. These pigments, then, are printed onto paper in tiny little cyan, magenta, yellow, and black dots.
If you were to take a magnifying glass to a magazine cover, for example, you would see that the main image is really just a bunch of dots spread out, some closer than others, to appear like the colors we want.
Images made in both colour modes can be printed, but the printers generally only use the CMYK mode to print.

61 The hydraulic brake is an arrangement of braking mechanism which uses brake fluid to transfer
1.  Pressure from the controlling mechanism to the braking mechanism
2.  Momentum from the angular belts to the wheel base
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Hydraulic brakes transfer energy to stop an object, normally a rotating axle. In a very simple brake system, with just two cylinders and a disc brake, the cylinders could be connected via tubes, with a piston inside the cylinders.
The cylinders and tubes are filled with incompressible oil. The two cylinders have the same volume, but different diameters, and thus different cross-section areas. The one with the smallest diameter is called the master cylinder.
The spinning disc brake will be placed down at[clarification needed] the piston with the larger cross-section. Suppose the diameter of the master
cylinder is half the diameter of the slave cylinder, so the master cylinder has a cross- section four times smaller.
Now, if the piston in the master cylinder is pushed down 40 mm, with 10 newtons
(N) of force, the slave piston will then move 10 mm, with a force of 40 N.

64 The non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) are
a)  Elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly
b)  Nominated by the permanent members of UNSC
c)  Appointed by the UN Secretary General
d)  Selected on rotation basis from the members of the General Assembly
Answer: A
The Council is composed of 15 Members:

Security Council.
A State which is a Member of the United Nations but not of the Security Council may participate, without a vote, in its discussions when the Council considers that that country's interests are affected.
Both Members and non-members of the United Nations, if they are parties to a dispute being considered by the Council, may be invited to take part, without a vote, in the Council's discussions; the Council sets the conditions for participation by a non-member State.

65 Consider the following statements about Neutrinos.
1.  They can be found only under the earth's crust.
2.  Human body cannot tolerate exposure to Neutrinos.
3.  They are used to trigger fission in nuclear reactors.
4.  They are completely massless.
5.  They have the ability to carry information from one part of the Universe to the other.
6.  They cannot reach electrically neutral states.
Choose the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  5 only
c)  3 and 4 only
d)  2, 4 and 6 only
Answer: B
Neutrinos are the information bearers of the universe ' which are almost never lost in their path. India's effort in studying neutrinos at INO may help us unravel the deepest mystery of the universe ' why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. So, 5 is correct.
Neutrinos are the least harmful of all elementary particles (so, 1 is wrong), as they almost never react with solid bodies. So, 2 is incorrect.
Also, people tend to confuse the 'neutrino' for the 'neutron'. This has also led
to the confusion that neutrinos can be weaponised, which is far from the truth.
They are not used to trigger fission reactions, but are instead produced as a result of the reactions. So, 3 is incorrect.
Neutrinos have mass and as shown recently, they change their masses too. So,
4 is incorrect.
Neutrinos, named as such because they are electrically neutral, are leptons, and so are not affected by the strong force either. So, 6 is wrong.

66 Consider the following statements about the Malabar rebellion.
1.  It was an armed uprising in 1921 against British authority and Hindu landlords.
2.  It began as a reaction against a heavy-handed crackdown on the Khilafat Movement by the British authorities in Kerala.
3.  The "Wagon tragedy" was related to this rebellion.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
It was launched by Mappila Muslims and was the culmination of a series of Mappila revolts that recurred throughout the 19th century and early 20th century.
The Mappilas attacked and took control of police stations, British government offices, courts and government treasuries.
In the later stages of the uprising, Mappilas committed several atrocities against the Hindu community, who they accused of helping the police to suppress their rebellion.

67 Public Choice Theory stresses on
1.  Single monolithic institution should deliver all public services.
2.  Only those services should be given for which a citizen can pay.
3.  Bureaucracy should be strengthened and there should be a single centre of power.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
All statements go against the philosophy of Public Choice Theory.
Public Choice Approach Theory strictly opposes the bureaucratic model of administration.
As per the theory, 'Perfection in the hierarchical ordering of a professionally trained public service accountable to a single centre of power will reduce the capability of a larger administrative system to respond to diverse preferences among citizens for many different public goods and services and cope with diverse environmental conditions."
It supports institutional pluralism and says that if market forces are allowed to operate freely, than there are full chances that they will function with much higher efficiency than the Government. Presence of market forces will reduce the unnecessarily inflated size of the Government /Bureaucracy and make the delivery of goods and services to the customers more transparent, cost-effective, simpler and economical.

68 What is Byssinosis?
a)  An occupational lung disease caused by exposure to cotton dust in inadequately ventilated working environments
b)  A disease prevalent in those working in deep coal mines that are cutoff from sunlight
c)  A nutrient deficiency among asbestos miners and those who work with asbestos insulation
d)  A symptom common among persons working in the information technology
sector
Answer: A
 It is also called "brown lung disease" or "Monday fever".
Byssinosis commonly occurs in workers who are employed in yarn and fabric manufacture industries. It is now thought that the cotton dust directly causes the disease and some believe that the causative agents are endotoxins that come from the cell walls of gram negative bacteria that grow on the cotton.
Although bacterial endotoxin is a likely cause, the absence of similar symptoms in workers in other industries exposed to endotoxins makes this uncertain.

69 In India, wild animals can be declared as vermin if
1.  They have become dangerous to human life or property
2.  Make the ecology aesthetically unclean
3.  Become disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
(MoEFCC) has declared Wild Pig as vermin in Uttarakhand for a year.
This decision will allow state forest authorities and people to carry out an extermination (hunting/poaching) of wild pigs outside the reserve forest on a large scale.
To do so, they will no longer require permission from the forest or wildlife officials and thus their actions cannot attract penal provisions of the WPA.
It will seek to balance local population of the wild pigs to mitigate the damage to human life, crops and other properties in the state for ensuring conservation of wildlife in forests.

2.  UN Secretary General
3.  Countries that contribute substantially to the UN Budget
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
Power of veto" refers to the veto power wielded solely by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States), enabling them to prevent the adoption of any "substantive" resolution, as well as decide which issues fall under "substantive" title.
This de facto control over the UN Security Council by the five governments is seen by critics, since its creation in 1945, as the most undemocratic character of the UN.
The veto is exercised when any permanent member'the so-called "P5"'casts a "negative" vote on a "substantive" draft resolution. Abstention or absence from the vote by a permanent member does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted.

73 Scientists recently successfully converted paper waste into green nontoxic cellulose aerogels. Aerogels find potential application in
1.  Improving drug delivery
2.  Oil spill cleaning
3.  Heat insulation materials for buildings
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Statement 1: It can be used in a drug delivery system owing to its biocompatibility. Due to its high surface area and porous structure, drugs can be adsorbed from supercritical CO2. The release rate of the drugs can be tailored by varying the properties of the aerogel.
Statement 2: It can be used as a chemical adsorber for cleaning up spills.
Statement 3: Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with a gas. The result is a solid with extremely low density and low thermal conductivity. It is nearly 98% air. So, it fits as a heat insulation material. 3 is correct.

Answer: A
Instead of consuming Indian production from abroad, these participant foreign nationals would consume it here in India.
In a way, it amounts to increased exports from India.
It cannot be Foreign Institutional Investment as that is an investment in the country's security markets from abroad. A visit to India is not needed.

important for Indian pharmaceutical companies?
a)  It allows them to do business in nations with frequent epidemic outbreaks
b)  It removes restrictions on export of generic drugs to developing countries
c)  It allows these companies to claim domestic patents globally
d)  It helps them participate in the global immunisation programme which is
facilitated through international procurement agencies like UNICEF
Answer: D
 Every year, billions of US dollars worth of medicines are purchased by or through international procurement agencies - such as UNICEF, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNITAID - for distribution in resource-limited countries.
The WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme (PQP) helps ensure that medicines supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy.
At the end of 2012, the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products contained 316 medicines for priority diseases.
WHO's list of prequalified medicinal products is used by international procurement agencies and increasingly by countries to guide bulk purchasing of medicines.
PQP also prequalifies active pharmaceutical ingredients and quality control laboratories.

79 Albedo is the fraction of solar energy which is
a)  Reflected from the Earth back into space
b)  Absorbed by autotrophic organisms
c)  Directly incident on Goldilocks zones
d)  Captured by clouds
Answer: A
 It is a measure of the reflectivity of the earth's surface. Ice, especially with snow on top of it, has a high albedo: most sunlight hitting the surface bounces back towards space.
Water is much more absorbent and less reflective. So, if there is a lot of water, more
solar radiation is absorbed by the ocean than when ice dominates.
Albedo is not important at high latitudes in winter: there is hardly any incoming sunlight to worry about. It becomes important in spring and summer when the radiation entering through leads can greatly increase the melt rate of the sea ice.

89 "2000K" written over a light bulb denotes which of the following?
a)  Longevity of the bulb
b)  Electricity consumption of the bulb
c)  Recycling ability of the bulb
d)  Colour Temperature of the Light
Answer: D
 Every light source has a distinct character, from the warm, dim glow of a candle to the blue, bright beam of a street light.
Brightness, measured in lumens, is one part of that character; the other part is color temperature.
Measured in degrees Kelvin, color temperature is not the ambient hot/cold temperature of our surroundings. In fact, the Kelvin scale goes backwards: The higher the color temperature, the cooler light gets, and the lower the color
temperature, the warmer light gets.

2000K is a warm colour temperature light.

The most important sites are Ajanta, Pitalkhora, Ellora, Nashik, Bhaja, Junnar, Karla, Kanheri. Ajanta, Ellora, and Kanheri continue to flourish.
Earlier it was presumed that because of the absence of the Buddha image, the caves were considered belonging to the orthodox faith of Buddhism, i.e., the Thervadins, but with the discovery of the Konkan Maurya inscription mentioning the Saka era
322, i.e., 400 CE, it is now satisfactorily proved that the cave activity in western
Deccan was an ongoing process.

95 To implement Basel III norms, Indian banks will have to
1.  Relinquish government control completely
2.  Float all their capital in money markets
3.  Allow a minimum foreign holding in every bank
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 The Basel III framework, whose main thrust has been enhancing the banking sector's safety and stability, emphasises the need to improve the quality and quantity of capital components, leverage (lending debt) ratio, liquidity standards,
and enhanced disclosures (transparency).
It does not recommend a clean sweep privatization of banks or floating all reserves in markets or necessary FDI stockholding in the bank. So, all statements are incorrect.

Many heads of states have been appointed as NAM Sec. Gen, e.g. Neelam Sanjeev
Reddy, Zail Singh etc. So, 2 is also wrong.
 Since the end of the Cold War and the formal end of colonialism, the Non-Aligned Movement has been forced to redefine itself and reinvent its purpose in the current world system.
In recent years the organization has criticized certain aspects of US foreign policy. The 2003 invasion of Iraq and the War on Terrorism, its attempts to stifle Iran and North Korea's nuclear plans, and its other actions have been denounced by some members of the Non-Aligned Movement as attempts to run roughshod over the sovereignty of smaller nations.

98 The source(s) of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPa) for humans is
1.  Leaching into food from food storage containers
2.  Through air and skin absorption
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 What is it: Bisphenol A (BPa) is a chemical produced in large quantities for use primarily in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins.
Statement 1: Bisphenol A can leach into food from the protective internal epoxy resin coatings of canned foods and from consumer products such as polycarbonate tableware, food storage containers, water bottles, and baby bottles. The degree to which BPA leaches from polycarbonate bottles into liquid may depend more on the temperature of the liquid or bottle, than the age of the container.
Statement 2: Besides diet, exposure can also occur through air and through skin absorption. Free BPA is found in high concentration in thermal paper and carbonless copy paper, which would be expected to be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets

100 The term North-South divide in the context of International affairs is related to
a)  A socio-economic and political divide between the Developed and
Developing World
b)  Differentiating between the Aggressor states and invaded states
c)  Former colonial occupations of Western powers in the Southern Hemisphere
d)  Diplomatic groupings formed within the Asian nations
Answer: A
 The North mostly covers the West and the First World, along with much of the Second World, while the South largely corresponds with the Third World.
While the North may be defined as the richer, more developed region and the South as the poorer, less developed region, many more factors differentiate between the two global areas. 95% of the North has enough food and shelter. Similarly, 95% of the North has a functioning educational system. In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter.
It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports".
As nations become economically developed, they may become part of the "North", regardless of geographical location, while any other nations which do not qualify for "developed" status are in effect deemed to be part of the "South".
