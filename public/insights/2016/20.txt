1 In tropical rainforests, soil is generally acidic and nutrient poor as nutrients are washed away by rain. How do then plants and canopy get nutrition from soil?
1.  Uptake of nutrients by plant roots is facilitated by mycorrhizae.
2.  Canopy trees are generally shallow rooted to tap a soil with low nutrient base
3.  Recycling of organic matter is fast in tropical rainforests so that nutrients locked in plants are not lost significantly
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Uptake of nutrients by plant roots is facilitated by a unique relationship between the roots and a fungi, mycorrhizae. The mycorrhizae attach to plant roots and are specialized to increase the efficiency of nutrient uptake nutrient from the soil.
Statement 2: Tropical rainforest trees are well-adapted to the poor soils of their environment. Since the first 6-8" (15-20 cm) of soil is a compost of decaying leaves, wood, and other organic matter, it is richest pool of nutrients on the ground. Canopy trees are generally shallow rooted to better tap this resource.
Statement 3: As vegetation dies, the nutrients are rapidly broken down and almost immediately returned to the system as they are taken up by living plants.
In the rainforest, most of the carbon and essential nutrients are locked up in living vegetation, dead wood, and decaying leaves. As organic material decays, it is recycled so quickly that few nutrients ever reach the soil, leaving it nearly sterile.
Decaying matter (dead wood and leaf litter) is processed so efficiently because of the abundance of decomposers including bacteria, fungi, and termites

2 Which of the following conditions favour the formation of deltas?
1.  The coast should be sheltered preferably tideless
2.  There should be large lakes in the course of the river that is to form the delta
3.  The sea adjoining the delta should be deep at shore.
User Name :      Kant
4.  There should be no strong currents running at right angles to the river mouth.
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 4 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
Conditions Favourable for Delta Formation
Active erosion of the river in its upper course to provide extensive gravel, sand and silt to be eventually deposited as deltas.
The coast should be sheltered preferably tideless, else delta will be washed away. So, 1 is correct.
There should be no strong current running at right angle to the river mouth, as it can wash away the sediments. So, 4 is correct.
Any large lake in the way or river course can filter off the sediments, thus unfavourable for delta formation. So, 2 is incorrect.
The sea should be shallow adjoining the delta as the sediments will disappear in the deep waters of the sea. So, 3 is incorrect.

3 Consider the following statements
1.  Assertion (a): The Government of India Act 1935 never envisaged states as autonomous units of governance.
2.  Reason (R): Power was never divided between the Centre and States, it was only delegated to the states by the Centre
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: D
User Name :      Kant
 The GoI Act 1935 did envisage states as autonomous units of governance.
The division of legislative powers, between the Centre and the Provinces is of special interest in view of the fact that the division made in the Indian Constitution between the Union and the States proceeds largely on the same lines.
It was not a mere delegation of power by the Centre to the Provinces as by
Rules made under the Government of India Act, 1919.
As already pointed out, the Government of India Act of 1935 itself divided the legislative powers between the Central and Provincial Legislatures and, subject to the provisions mentioned below, neither Legislature could transgress the powers assigned to the other.
A three-fold division was made in the Act: There was a Federal List over which the Federal Legislature had exclusive powers of legislation and so forth.

4 Why limestone dominated areas have little agricultural activities and are sparsely populated?
a)  Limestone increases the acidity of the soil.
b)  Limestone is soluble in water.
c)  Limestone releases carbon dioxide that makes growing crops impossible in the area.
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
 Limestone neutralizes the natural acidity of the soil. So, (a) statement itself is wrong. In fact calcerous clays are used in vineyards to improve drainage for the crop.
Limestone released CO2 when it reacts with water. But, that is not the major problem since plants can uptake the extra CO2. So, (b) is wrong too.
Solubility of limestone makes it ineffective to grow major crops. Moreover, the landforms made by limestone make an area difficult as a habitat for humans.

5 Consider the following statements
1.  Assertion (a): India is the largest importers of Defence goods.
2.  Reason (R): India has the largest armed forces.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: C
 India has the third largest armed forces with an annual budget of around $ 40 Billion. 40 % of it is for capital acquisition. So, R is wrong.
India also happens to be one of the largest importers of Defence goods. Reason is more technological than anything else.
The nation aspires to change this situation. While ensuring that the Defence services always get the best quality equipment, India aims to achieve substantial self reliance and indigenization in Defence equipment technology.

6 The Panama Papers leaked recently have added an even greater urgency to the issue of tackling black money in India. Black money refers to that part of an individual's wealth that has been
1.  Evading taxes
2.  Earned illegally
3.  Stashed in bank accounts maintained abroad
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
User Name :      Kant
Answer: A
 If the money has been earned illegally, there is no question of paying taxes on it.
In India, Black money refers to funds earned in the black market, on which income and other taxes have not been paid.
Black money is the money that is unaccounted for.
Black money would also include legal income that is concealed from public authorities to evade taxes, public contributions or to evade compliance with several acts such as minimum wages act. So, both 1 and 2 will be correct. An individual can maintain an account abroad and save money in it. It is perfectly legal. What is illegal is hiding the money and its source, which is what has been leaked by Panama papers.

7 Alexander's invasion of India resulted in which of the following?
a)  Annexation of north-western India
b)  Increase in naval explorations between India and West Asia
c)  Political disintegration of North India
d)  Small states started ruling independently without the patronage of larger kingdoms
Answer: B
  The immediate effect of Alexander's invasion was that it encouraged political unification of north India under the Mauryas. So, (c) is wrong.
The system of small independent states came to an end. So, (d) is wrong. Alexander's invasion had also paved the way for direct contact between India and
Greece. The routes opened by him and his naval explorations increased the existing
facilities for trade between India and West Asia. So, (b) is correct.
However, his aim of annexing the northwestern India to his empire was not fulfilled
User Name :      Kant
due his premature death. His authority in the Indus valley was a short-lived one because of the expansion of Mauryan Empire under Chandragupta Maurya. So, (a) is wrong.

8 A news channel proves with conclusive evidence that a member of the Central Information Commission has indulged in corrupt practices. The appeal for his removal reaches the Central government. How can the member be removed?
a)  The Prime Minister may end his contract on an enquiry conducted by the
Cabinet Secretariat
b)  The Parliament passes an impeachment motion by a simple majority
c)  The Chief Information Commissioner may remove his from his office.
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 The President can remove the Chief Information Commissioner or any
Information Commissioner from the office under the following circumstances:
if he is adjudged an insolvent; or
if he has been convicted of an offence which (in the opinion of the President)
involves a moral turpitude; or
if he engages during his term of office in any paid employment outside the duties of his office; etc
In addition to these, the President can also remove the Chief Information Commissioner or any Information Commissioner on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.
However, in these cases, the President has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the Supreme Court, after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises so, then the President can remove him.

9 Consider the following statements
1.  Assertion (a): The Commission can order suo moto inquiry into matters related to
RTI Act if there are reasonable grounds.
User Name :      Kant
2.  Reason (R): The RTI Act 2005 declares the CIC to be a "Judicial authority".
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: C
 CIC functions as a quasi-judicial authority. But, the RTI Act does not make it either a tribunal or a judicial authority
While inquiring, the Commission has the powers of a civil court in several matters. It can also order suo moto inquiry.
During the inquiry of a complaint, the Commission may examine any record which
is under the control of the public authority and no such record may be withheld from it on any grounds
In other words, all public records must be given to the Commission during inquiry for examination.

Statement 2: It will be financed through Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF), Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), schemes of MLAs and CSR funds
Statement 3: They are separate missions. So, 3 is wrong.

11 The largest holder of Government of India dated securities (G-Secs) is/are
a)  Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
b)  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
c)  National Pension System (NPS)
d)  Commercial Banks
Answer: D
 A Government security is a tradable instrument issued by the Central Government or the State Governments. It acknowledges the Government's debt obligation.
Dated Government securities are long term securities and carry a fixed or floating coupon (interest rate) which is paid on the face value.
Banks are the largest holders of G-secs. About one-third of the net demand and time liabilities of the banks are invested in G-secs mainly to meet statutory liquidity requirements and partly for investment purposes.
Apart from banks, insurance companies and provident funds have substantial holdings of G-secs - almost one-fifth of the outstanding G-secs are held by these institutions.
Other investors in G-secs include mutual funds, primary and satellite dealers, and trusts.

No bill or amendment could be introduced in the Legislature without the Governor-General's previous sanction, with respect to certain matters, e.g., if the Bill or amendment sought to repeal or amend or was repugnant to any law of the British Parliament extending to India or any Governor-General's or Governor's Act, or if it sought to affect matters as respects which the
Governor-General was required to act in his discretion.

13 Green Box subsidies under WTO are allowed because they are considered to be
a)  Minimally trade distorting
b)  Higher among developed and relatively lower for developing countries.
c)  They are confined to agriculture sector.
d)  They are related to GATS provision
Answer: A
 In WTO terminology, subsidies in general are identified by "boxes" which are given the colours of traffic lights: green (permitted), amber (slow down - i.e. be reduced), red (forbidden).
The Agriculture Agreement has no red box, although domestic support
User Name :      Kant
exceeding the reduction commitment levels in the amber box is prohibited; and there is a blue box for subsidies that are tied to programmes that limit production.
There are also exemptions for developing countries (sometimes called an
"S&D box).
In order to qualify, green box subsidies must not distort trade, or at most cause minimal distortion. So, (a) is correct.
They have to be government-funded (not by charging consumers higher prices) and must not involve price support
They also include environmental protection and regional development programmes.So,(c) is wrong.

18 Marginal productivity of a labour is zero in case of
a)  Disguised unemployment
b)  High unemployment
c)  More capital intensive industries
d)  Non-availability of alternate employment
Answer: A
 Marginal productivity of labour means additional output that should come by adding an extra labour
When too many people are employed (e.g. in an agricultural field of size 1 hectare,
400 people are employed), it makes any additional labour redundant. So, its productivity falls to zero.

21 Phenomenon like capillary action helps plant roots take water from soil. Capillary action is based on which property of water?
a)  Surface tension
b)  Adhesion to surrounding surface
c)  Cohesion between water molecules
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 It is defined as the movement of water within the spaces of a porous material due to the forces of adhesion, cohesion, and surface tension.
Capillary action occurs because water is sticky, thanks to the forces of cohesion (water molecules like to stay close together) and adhesion (water molecules are attracted and stick to other substances).
Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel will cause an upward force on the liquid at the edges and result in a meniscus which turns upward. The surface tension acts to hold the surface intact.
Capillary action occurs when the adhesion to the walls is stronger than the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules.
The height to which capillary action will take water in a uniform circular tube
(picture to left) is limited by surface tension and, of course, gravity.

24 Why no or little photosynthesis takes place in blue and green color light?
a)  They are highly energetic
b)  Chlorophyll doesn't strongly absorb these lights.
c)  Their magnetic properties are more than white coloured lights
d)  The heat content is low in blue and green colour lights.
Answer: B
 Chlorophyll absorbs red light the best, and converts the light into energy that it uses for metabolism.
It doesn't strongly absorb blue or green light, so plants can't use this energy for photosynthesis.
White light contains all the colors, and plants appear green because they absorb the red light, leaving what appears to us as green light, to be seen by our eyes.

25 You are aggrieved by an order of the Municipality. You submit a grievance redressal request to the District nodal officer who handles the matter. But, your representation is rejected. The officer rejected your application because

26 Your weight as measured by a spring balance can be zero if
a)  You are in a state of free fall
b)  Your distance from the earth doubles
c)  You are revolving in a circular orbit around the earth.
d)  Both (a) and (c)
Answer: D
 Weight is mass multiplied by the acceleration (due to gravity) you are experiencing.
When a man moves in a circular orbit around the earth, he is in a state of free fall, though he is not actually falling.
The gravitational force acting on him equals the centrifugal force both cancelling each other. Net acceleration is zero. This makes his weight zero.

27 The Parliament can create new all-India services only when

29 Which of the following statements about the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) is
INCORRECT?
a)  Chairman and members of the CAT enjoy the status of judges of High Courts as per statutory provisions
b)  Its members must be qualified to be a judge of a High court or have served as one
c)  Members are appointed by the President
d)  Appeals against the orders of the CAT can be made in both the Supreme
Court and the High courts

Option (a): With the amendment in Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 in 2006, the members have been given the status of judges of High Courts.
Option (b) and (c): They are drawn from both judicial and administrative streams appointed by the president.
Option (d): Originally, appeals against the orders of the CAT could be made only in the Supreme Court and not in the high courts.
However, in the Chandra Kumar case (1997), the Supreme Court declared this restriction on the jurisdiction of the High Courts as unconstitutional, holding that judicial review is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

b)  British occupation of India
c)  Proposals of the Cabinet Mission
d)  Forced participation of India in WW-II
Answer: A

 The immediate issues of the revolt were living conditions and food. Issue of INA trials further fuelled the mutiny.
The mutineers in the armed forces got no support from the national leaders and were largely leaderless.

31 The minerals under the waters of the ocean within the territorial waters of India and its exclusive economic zone near a coastal state is owned by
a)  The concerned State Government
b)  The Central Government
c)  Local government
d)  Owned jointly by Central, State and Local governments
Answer: B
 All lands, minerals and other things of value under the waters of the ocean within the territorial waters of India, the continental shelf of India and the exclusive economic zone of India vests in the Union.
Hence, a state near the ocean cannot claim jurisdiction over these things. India's territorial waters extend to a distance of 12 nautical miles from the appropriate base line.
Similarly, India's exclusive economic zone extends upto 200 nautical miles.

32 Consider the following statements
1.  Assertion (a): Under the Constitution, the civil servants are conferred personal immunity from legal liability for official contracts signed in official capacity.
2.  Reason (R): Government is liable for that official contract
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
User Name :      Kant
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: A
 Statement A means that the civil servant who made a contract in his official capacity is not personally liable in respect of that contract but it is the government (Central or state) that is liable for the contract.
But, if the contract is made without complying the conditions specified in the
Constitution, then the civil servant who made the contract is personally liable.
Further, the civil servants also enjoy immunity from legal liability for their tortious acts in respect of the sovereign functions of the government. In other cases, the liability of the civil servants for torts or illegal acts is the same as of any ordinary citizen.
The Constitution does not grant any immunity to the ministers for their official acts. But, since they are not required to countersign (as in Britain) the official acts of the president and the governors, they are not liable in the courts for those acts.

42 Tax buoyancy is an indicator to measure efficiency and responsiveness of revenue mobilization in response to
a)  Growth in the Gross domestic product
b)  Increase in working age population
c)  Increase in tax rates
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
Taxes are said to be buoyant if the tax revenues increase more than proportionately in response to a rise in national income or output.
Sometimes this perception is then linked to the Laffer Curve - the idea that tax revenues will increase in response to lower rates because of higher compliance.
A similar looking concept is tax elasticity. It refers to changes in tax revenue in response to changes in tax rate. For example, how tax revenue changes if the government reduces corporate income tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent indicate tax elasticity.

Statement 2: If cohesion between the liquid is more than the adhesion with the material, it will not stick. It will exist separately. Mercury is a good example.
In case of water adhesion to the material is strong, and cohesion between its own molecules is weaker. So, it sticks.

48 Monetised deficit means
a)  Fiscal deficit less interest payments
b)  Government expenditure which is financed through the sale of adhoc treasury bills
c)  Increase in RBI credit to Central Government
d)  Fiscal deficit less loans and advances
Answer: C
 Besides ways and means advances, the Reserve Bank of India also supports the government's borrowing programme. Monetised deficit indicates the level of support extended by the Reserve Bank of India to the government's borrowing programme.
Monetised deficit is defined as net increase in net Reserve Bank of India credit to central government. The rationale for this measure of deficit flows from the inflationary impact which a budgetary deficit exerts on the economy.
Since borrowings from Reserve Bank of India directly add to money supply, this measure is termed monetised deficit. It is obvious that monetised deficit is only a part of fiscal deficit.

51 Grants from the Centre to the States under the recommendations of Finance
Commission are known as
a)  Plan grants
b)  Development assistance
c)  Statutory grants
d)  Discretionary grants
Answer: C
 Vertical and horizontal imbalances are common features of most federations.
The Constitution assigned taxes with a nation-wide base to the Union to make the country one common economic space unhindered by internal barriers to the extent possible.
States being closer to people and more sensitive to the local needs have been assigned functional responsibilities involving expenditure disproportionate to their assigned sources of revenue resulting in vertical imbalances.
The devolution of taxes from the centre helps them fulfil these responsibilities.

 As per the Economic Survey 2012-13, there is significant divergence in India between the official rates of taxes and the actual or effective rate of taxation (which is a simple 'ratio of tax revenue collected to the tax base').
This arises on account of the exemptions to the tax rate. As indicated earlier in the section on collection rates, the magnitude of revenue foregone (i.e. tax expenditure) is indeed high.
In case of the direct taxes, for e.g. tax foregone on account of exemptions under corporate income tax for 2011-12 was more than Rs. 50,000 crore.

b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
Winds blowing across the ocean surface push water away. Water then rises up from beneath the surface to replace the water that was pushed away. This process is known as "upwelling."
Upwelling occurs in the open ocean and along coastlines.
Water that rises to the surface as a result of upwelling is typically colder and is rich in nutrients.
These nutrients "fertilize" surface waters, meaning that these surface waters often have high biological productivity. Therefore, good fishing grounds typically are found where upwelling is common.

More than 59% Indians list a language other than Hindi as their
mother tongue. So, Hindi is the mother tongue of only nearly 41% of the population.
As per the 2001 census, around 42.2 crore people listed Hindi as their mother tongue, of which 25.79 crore spoke Hindi in its pure form, and another 16.41 crore in 49 mother tongues similar to Hindi.
As for other scheduled languages, Bengali was the most spoken mother- tongue after Hindi (with 8.11% of the country's population citing it as their mother tongue), followed by Telugu (7.19%), Marathi (6.99%), Tamil (5.91%) and Urdu (5.01%).
Only a dozen states - including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Jharkhand - had a majority of their population listing Hindi as their mother tongue.

72 Mid-Oceanic Ridges form an interconnected chain of mountain system within the ocean. It is characterised by a central rift system at the crest. The rift system at the crest is the
a)  Zone of maximum tectonic stability
b)  Zone of intense volcanic activity
c)  Plateau's offshoot that has been stable over past some time
d)  Zone of Wegner's Oscillations
Answer: B
 It is the longest mountain-chain on the surface of the earth though submerged under the oceanic waters.
It is characterised by a central rift system at the crest, a fractionated plateau and flank zone all along its length.
The rift system at the crest is the zone of intense volcanic activity.
There is no such zone of Wegner's Oscillations. So, all options other than (b) are wrong.

Statement 2 and 3: Climate change is expected to make water resources scarcer and encourage weeds and pests. Increased temperatures provide a better breeding ground for many pests. Moreover, as climates "migrate", insects and fungi are moving toward the poles too affecting crops in temperate regions.
Statement 4: Seafood is a large part of many people's diets around the world. And many marine species can't survive in the more acidic environment, for e.g. planktons which form the basis of food chain.

77 During periods of weak growth in the economy, a "fiscal stimulus" can be given by which of the following?
1.  Increasing spending on MGNREGA
2.  Printing currency
3.  Reducing the repo rate
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
Fiscal stimulus is an increase in public spending or a reduction in the level of taxation that might be performed by a government in order to encourage and support economic growth.
Increase in MGNREGA funding will accrue directly to the people and will end up increasing consumption demand in India. So, 1 is correct.
User Name :      Kant
Printing currency will increase the money supply and likely to pull growth from demand side in the short-run. So, 2 is correct.
Statement 3 is a monetary policy measure.
Also, most government bailout packages offered to various business types can be considered a form of fiscal stimulus.

78 During autumn and spring season there is a bloom of phytoplankton growth in lakes. Why?
a)  The moisture in atmosphere is most conducive for their growth.
b)  In these seasons, the lake water churns and redistributes water and oxygen.
c)  No vertical air currents flow in these seasons along the water that may disturb the planktons.
d)  It is a natural cycle of growth of phytoplankton and has nothing to do with
seasons.
Answer: B
 In summer and winter, water across layers of lake hardly mixes. So, either the upper layer or deep water is cold or warm.
Hence, there is little churning of oxygen and nutrients.
But, due to similar water temperatures at both surface and under water in autumn and spring, water tends to mix.
Mixing of water brings nutrients where its most desirable for plankton's growth.

81 Which of the following ecosystems is most likely to survive?
a)  More species diversity, less evenness among species, more number of
Ecotones and lesser dominance of one particular species
b)  Less species diversity, more evenness among species, less number of
Ecotones and greater dominance of one particular species
c)  More species diversity, more evenness among species, less number of
Ecotones and more dominance of one particular species
d)  Less species diversity, less evenness among species, less number of Ecotones and lesser dominance of one particular species
Answer: A
 A more diverse ecosystem is more stable, remember this as the golden rule.
If there is less evenness among species, there will be greater diversity. If there are more number of Ecotones, there will be a lot of transition zones (e.g. ponds, grasslands etc), and there will be greater species diversity and inter-dependence.
Finally, if less number of species dominate, it is good for the ecosystem diversity even more. So, (a) is the best choice amongst all, (b) is the least stable.

82 Inter-tidal zone is the space on the shores between the areas of high tide and low tide and supports the growth of Mangroves the best. Why?
1.  It is rich in nutrients.
2.  It allows mangroves to be submerged in water for at least a part in the day.
Which of the above is/are correct?
User Name :      Kant
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Mangroves are plants and shrubs that live on the land but are flooded by sea water for part of each day. This flooding is the high tide.
In most places there are two high tides and two low tides each day. This inter-tidal zone is the area that is exposed to the air at low tide and flooded at high tide.
Mangroves are able to live in the intertidal zone because they are special plants with special organs that help them to live in salty surroundings and in poor soil.

Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans.
The conditions favourable for the formation and intensification of tropical storms are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weaklow-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system.
The energy that intensifies the storm, comes from the condensation process in the cumulonimbus clouds.

89 "Crowding out effect" often discussed amongst policymakers is related to
a)  Impact of government borrowing on private borrowing
b)  Adverse effect of population on economic growth
c)  Pull down effect of inflation on real economic growth
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
Sometimes, government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy stance and increases its spending to boost the economic activity. This leads to an increase in interest rates. Increased interest rates affect private investment decisions.
A high magnitude of the crowding out effect may even lead to lesser income in the economy.
With higher interest rates, the cost for funds to be invested increases and affects their accessibility to debt financing mechanisms.
This leads to lesser investment ultimately and crowds out the impact of the initial rise in the total investment spending.

2.  Earth becomes flatter in shape.
3.  There are major changes in the mass distribution within the earth.
4.  The mass of earth increases.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2, 3 and 4 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  3 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
Statement 1: Tilt has nothing to do with gravitation.
Statement 2 and 3: If the shape of earth changes, the way its mass is distributed will also shift a little. It will not be a sphere, and we will have to calculate the value of "g" (acceleration due to gravity) differently. So, as "g" varies, your weight will vary.
Statement 4: If earth's mass increases, the value of "g" will increase and your weight will too.

92 If an economy is producing at its peak potential GDP, an increase in money supply in the short-term is most likely to result in
a)  Stagflation
b)  Demand-side inflation
c)  Recession
d)  High unemployment
Answer: B
In such a situation the economy cannot produce more irrespective of how much ever funding is available at whatever interest rates. No new investment or production will occur.
So, the increased money supply will only lead to increased demand for goods, and given the limited supply it will result in demand side inflation.
Recession and stagflation are extreme cases. Only when this increase in money supply is sustained, will it start affecting output considerably. Even then the effects cannot be predicted, which depends on the structure of the economy.
But, the most certain option here is (b), and hence the answer.

b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
User Name :      Kant
d)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
Answer: A
It occurs due to continentality.
Temperatures are more moderate in regions where oceans dominate over land. They are more extreme where there is only land and no ocean.
The southern hemisphere is 81 per cent water-covered. The northern hemisphere surface is only 61 per cent water.
This causes seasonal variations to be more moderate in the southern hemisphere than at the corresponding northern latitudes.
