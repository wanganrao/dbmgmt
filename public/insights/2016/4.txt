1 Which of the following about Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of a state is CORRECT?
a)  It is a sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC).
b)  It does not come within the territorial waters of the state.
c)  A state cannot use EEZs to install any energy installations.
d)  Use of marine resources from EEZ is not permitted unless agreed to by neighbouring states.
Answer: B
 It is prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law on the
Seas. So, (a) is incorrect.
The difference between the territorial sea and the EEZ is that the former confers full sovereignty over the waters, whereas the second is merely a "sovereign right" which refers to the coastal state's rights below the surface of the sea, for e.g. to exploit marine resources or energy resources or any other resource. So (c) and (d) are wrong, but (b) is correct.

2 Suppose 'Nation A' has a higher Gini coefficient than 'Nation B'. What can you definitely conclude from this?
1.  Nation A is economically wealthier than Nation B.
2.  Nation B has better social indicators than Nation A.
3.  Nation A has higher level of environmental degradation than Nation B.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Gini coefficient is intended to represent the income distribution of a nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measure of inequality.
A nation with a Gini score of 0 has perfect income equality, and score of 100 has perfect inequality (i.e. all the wealth is owned by a single person).
If Gini coefficient of Nation A is higher than nation B, there is no guarantee that Nation A will be wealthier or poorer than Nation
b) For e.g. Brazil has a higher Gini than Canada, the latter is wealthier. So, statement 1 is wrong.
Similarly it is possible that a more unequal nation has better social indicators than a more equal nation. For e.g. USA has higher Gini coefficient than India; yet the former has better social indicators.
Similarly, no conclusive inference can be drawn about statement 3, which will also be wrong.

3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on the fact that
1.  Magnetic field inside our bodies is similar and equal in magnitude to that of earth.
2.  Heat generated by our body parts can be traced by electromagnetic field.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 The magnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body parts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). But, these fields are very weak and are about one- billionth of the earth's magnetic field. So, statement 1 is wrong.
MRI is not based on tracing heat patterns. Statement 2 is wrong.
 An electric current always produces a magnetic field. Even weak ion currents that travel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch something, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This impulse produces a temporary magnetic field. Analysis of these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses in medicine.
You might have observed that 'danger' signal lights are red in colour. The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore, it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.

4 Culturable waste land is a category of land use in India. It means the land which
a)  is used only once in an agricultural season and rest of the time as pasture lands
b)  has not been sown more than once during periods of drought
c)  has the potential to be used for agriculture but is not being used for cultural reasons
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Culturable waste land is left uncultivated for more than 5 agricultural years. It is a category of uncultivable land. So, all options except (d) are incorrect.
Area sown more than once in an agricultural year plus net sown area is known as gross cropped area.
Uncultivated land (excluding fallow land) includes (a) Permanent pastures and grazing land, (b) Land under miscellaneous tree crops groves (not included in net sown area), (c) Culturable waste land (left uncultivated for more than 5 agricultural years).

5 A mixture of oxygen and ethyne is burnt for welding. Why a mixture of ethyne and air is not used?
1.  Ethyne may not burn completely with air as with pure oxygen.
2.  Without mixing oxygen, it is difficult to reach high temperatures needed for welding.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
When ethyne is burnt with air, it gives a yellow sooty flame which has much lower temperatures. This is because ethyne is not burnt completely. So, statement 1 is correct.
When pure oxygen is used, the flame is cleaner, combustion of ethyne is complete and much higher temperatures can be used with lesser quantities of ethyne. So, statement 2 is correct.
Moreover, air contains many gases other than oxygen which may be undesirable in the process of welding. This is why oxygen is used instead of air.

6 In music, the term note is generally used to represent
a)  the relative duration and pitch of a sound
b)  the loudness and softness of a sound
c)  the interval frequency between two sounds
d)  a style or school of music
Answer: A
The term "note" in music describes the pitch and the duration of a musical sound. The pitch describes how low or high a note sounds. So, (a) is correct.
The same note can sound soft or loud depending on how its played. So, (b) is correct.
Sound is made up of vibrations or waves. These waves have a speed or frequency that they vibrate at. The pitch of the note changes depending on the frequency of these vibrations. The higher the frequency of the wave, the higher the pitch of the note will sound.
In music there are specific pitches that make up standard notes. In the Indian system of music, there are seven musical notes in a scale - sa, re, ga, ma, pa, da, ni. In the west, they use the notations - do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti.

7 Between the years of formation of Indian National Congress (1885) and Non-cooperation
Movement (1920), forest cover in the Indian subcontinent declined substantially due to
1.  Expansion of Railways
2.  Commercial farming
3.  British economic needs in First World War
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
  Statement 1: Growth of industries and urban centres, ships and railways, created a new demand on the forests for timber and other forest products.
Statement 2: Colonial control was established over the forests, forest areas were mapped, trees were classified, and plantations were developed after clearing forests.
Statement 3: The First World War and the Second World War had a major impact on forests. In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and the forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs.
In Java, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed 'a scorched earth' policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese hands.

8 Bagasse can be used to manufacture
1.  Biofuel
2.  Paper
3.  Fertilizers
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 Sugarcane yields molasses and bagasse among other products. Bagasse is the fibrous matter that remains after sugarcane or sorghum stalks are crushed to extract their juice.
Molasses is used as an ingredient for manufacturing fertilizers, not bagasse. So, 3 is wrong.
Bagasse is often used as a primary fuel source for sugar mills; when burned in quantity, it produces sufficient heat energy to supply all the needs of a typical sugar mill. So, 1 is correct.
Bagasse is commonly used as a substitute for wood in many tropical and subtropical countries for the production of pulp, paper (even for
newspapers) and board, such as India, China, Colombia, Iran, Thailand and
Argentina. So, 2 is correct.

9 Dialysis using an artificial kidney is based on the principle of
a)  Gravity flow
b)  Diffusion
c)  Pascal's law
d)  Archimedes' principle
Answer: B
  Dialysis works on the principles of the diffusion of solutes and ultra-filtration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane. Diffusion is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Blood flows by one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. So, (b) is correct.
Pascal's law states that when there is an increase in pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other point in the container. This is not used in dialysis. So, (c) is wrong.
Archimedes' principle is related to buoyancy and floating of objects in a fluid. So, (d) is wrong.
Gravity flow is not enough to perform dialysis. So, (a) is wrong.

10 'X' develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan plateau. It can be found in thepiedmont zone of the Western Ghats and can be diffused with iron. 'X' here refers to
a)  Peaty and marshy soils
b)  Red and Yellow Soil
c)  Laterite Soil
d)  Forest Soil
Answer: B
 Peaty and marshy soils are found in Kerala, coastal track of Orissa, Sunderban area of W.B. So, (a) is wrong.
A soil that is diffused with Iron generally develops red colour, and in hydrated form occurs in yellow colour. This criteria is fulfilled by red and yellow soil. So, (b) is correct.
Laterite soil occurs in region of high rainfall. So, (c) can be ruled out.
Forest soils occur at high elevations as well as at low elevations, where the rainfall is sufficient to support trees. So, (d) is ruled out as the statements mentions piedmont (foothills) region of western ghats.
 Generally red soils are light textured with porous and friable structure
and there is absence of lime Kankar and free carbonates. They have neutral to acidic reaction and are deficient in nitrogen humus, phosphoric acid and lime.
Forest soils are very shallow, steep, stony, and infertile for the production of field crops.
Peaty and Marshy soils: when the vegetation growing in such wet places dies, it decomposes very slowly dues to excessive wetness of soils and after several hundreds of year a layer of partly decayed organic matter accumulates on the surface, giving rise to such peaty and marshy soils. These are black coloured, heavy and highly acidic soils. When properly drained and fertilized, these soils produce good crops of rice.

11 Strip cropping method involves
a)  Cutting strips up and down the slope to form channels for the quick flow of irrigation water
b)  Establishing sand dunes in and around the crop in dry regions
c)  Cropping different crops in alternate rows to reduce soil erosion
d)  Leaving strips of grass to grow between the crops
Answer: D
  Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This breaks up the force of the wind. This method is
known as strip cropping.
Planting lines of trees to create shelter also works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are called shelter belts. These shelter belts have contributed significantly to the stabilisation of sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in western India.

12 Consider the following about the Lepchas.
1.  They are the aboriginal inhabitants of Uttarakhand.
2.  They have developed their own language.
3.  The famous 'Khaddar' shawl in woven by the community.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: B
  The Lepchas are the aboriginal inhabitants of Sikkim and they are mostly settled in North Sikkim. Some population can also be found in WB, Nepal, Bhutan etc. So, statement 1 is wrong.
The Lepcha have their own language, also called Lepcha. It belongs to the Bodish- Himalayish group of Tibeto-Burman languages. The Lepcha write their language in their own script, called Rng or Lepcha script, which is derived from the Tibetan script. It was developed between the 17th and 18th century. So, statement 2 is correct.
Khaddar is a shawl woven in Punjab. So, statement 3 is wrong.

13 Auxin performs which of the following functions in plants?
a)  Regulates growth and b)  Performs reproductive functions
c)  Protects against pests and insects
d)  Helps synthesize products of photosynthesis
Answer: A
 When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.
This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light.
Other such plant hormones (that help in promoting growth) are cytokinin (promote cell division), gibberellins (help stems grow).
But plants also need signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which inhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.
These are important hormones. You should ideally at least remember their names as questions may be asked based on these in UPSC.

14 Himlayan Yew is an important plant for medicinal plant found in various parts of Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh. It has been characterized as endangered by IUCN due to
1.  Depletion of inter-species gene bank of Yew
2.  Threat of bio-piracy
3.  Soaking of groundwater in areas where it is present
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
  Yew has undergone a recent, range-wide population decline of at least 50 % as per IUCN.
Throughout its range in the western Himalayas, it is declining in response to a range of threats. In Afghanistan, up to 50% of the forests where it occurs have been destroyed or heavily logged (UNEP 2003) over the last 30 years.
In northwest India and western Nepal, exploitation associated with Taxol production has led to a national decline of up to 90% in Taxus populations throughout the country.
Also, in other countries such as Pakistan, overexploitation for fuel, fodder and medicinal use has led to a significant decline.
The decline is continuing and while the causes are largely understood, in many areas they will not be reversible. On this basis an assessment of Endangered is warranted.

15 Power of a lens is roughly dependent upon
a)  Curvature of the lens
b)  Height of the lens
c)  Size of the lens
d)  Width of the lens
Answer: A
 Focal length of a lens depends on its curvature and the medium outside the lens.
The general formula (not important for the exam, just for illustration here) is
(image):
Here R1 and R2 are internal/external radii of the lens, and 'n' represents the medium.
Ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of short focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing them closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens
of very short focal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal
length. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length.

16 The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to
1.  Increase the illumination of the bulb
2.  Prolong the life of filament
3.  Change the heat profile of the filament
4.  Reduce the power consumption of the bulb
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 4 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: D
In a bulb, when current passes through the filament it produces light and heat both. Metals like tungsten (which are used as filament) glowing brightly may oxidise at high temperatures if normal gases are filled inside the bulb.
Filling of inert gases like nitrogen and argon prevents oxidation of the filament and increase its life. So, 2 is correct.
Inert gases do not play any other role like increasing power efficiency, illumination, changing heat profile of the filament etc. So, 1, 3 and 4 are incorrect.
They may reduce the heat emitted by the bulb to some extent as the bulb's inside is properly insulated. To avoid confusion, we had not given any option as "2 and 3 only".

17 Apart from Chipko movement, which of the following are environmental movements?
1.  Save Silent Valley
2.  Beej Bachao Andolan
3.  Navdanya Movement
4.  Namantar Andolan
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2, 3 and 4 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: D
  Silent Valley Movement has been covered in an earlier 
Namantar Andolan is a dalit movement.
Beej Bachao Andolan drew links between the erosion of agricultural biodiversity and rural livelihoods, and sought to preserve the people's cultural and scientific patrimony, as well as fight back against agrarian policies that favour corporate agribusiness at the expense of small farmers.
Navdanya is a women centred movement for Earth Democracy based on the philosophy of 'Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam' (The Earth as one Family) for conserving biodiversity, conserving knowledge of the seed and its utilization, conserving culture, conserving sustainability.
It has created awareness on the hazards of genetic engineering, defended people's knowledge from biopiracy and food rights in the face of globalisation and climate change.

18 Multi-purpose river projects can pose which of the following environmental and geological problems?
1.  Triggering earthquakes
2.  Excessive sedimentation of river bed
3.  Making migration difficult for fishes
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
  Statement 1: The most widely accepted explanation of how dams cause earthquakes is related to the extra water pressure created in the micro-cracks and fissures in the ground under and near a reservoir. When the pressure of the water in the rocks increases, it acts to lubricate faults which are already under tectonic strain, but are prevented from slipping by the friction of the rock surfaces. Sichuan earthquake can be one such example.
Statement 2: All rivers contain sediments. When a river is stilled behind a dam, the sediments it contains sink to the bottom of the reservoir. As the sediments accumulate in the reservoir, so the dam gradually loses its ability to store water for the purposes for which it was built. It results in rockier stream beds and poorer habitats for the rivers' aquatic life. If sedimentation continues, it increases water level and can even cause floods.
Statement 3: The construction of a dam on a river can block or delay upstream fish migration and thus contribute to the decline and even the extinction of species that depend on longitudinal movements along the stream continuum during certain phases of their life cycle. Mortality resulting from fish passage through hydraulic turbines or over spillways during their downstream migration can be significant.
Additional: The reservoirs that are created on the floodplains also submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over a period of time.
Sedimentation also means that the flood plains (ahead of dam) are deprived of silt, a natural fertiliser, further adding on to the problem of land degradation.
It was also observed that multi-purpose projects caused waterborne diseases and pests and pollution resulting from excessive use of water.

19 In Meghalaya, a 200-year-old system of tapping stream and spring water by using bamboo pipes, is prevalent among tribal farmers of Khasi and Jaintia Hills. Why bamboo drip irrigation is used instead of groundwater irrigation techniques?
a)  Water cannot be directed using pipes in the hills
b)  Soil has low water retention capacity due to rocky terrain
c)  Due to presence of traditional terrace agriculture
d)  There is large scale problem of water stagnation and water logging
Answer: B
The Jaintia, Khasi, and Garo hills of Meghalaya are largely made up of steep slopes and generally rocky terrain where the soil has low water retention capacity and where the use of groundwater channels is impossible. So, (b) is correct.
Water can be directed using pipes, but it can be expensive in a hilly terrain for tribals. So, (a) can not be the answer.
Since the soil has low water retention capacity, water stagnation and logging cannot take place at large scale levels. So, (d) is wrong.
 This timeless and traditional technology uses locally available material while harnessing the forces of gravity. An assortment of holed bamboo shoots zig- zag downhill, diverting the natural flow of streams and springs across terraced cropland. The advantages of using bamboo are two-fold: it prevents leakage, increasing crop yield with less water, and makes use of natural, local, and inexpensive material.

20 Blue colour of the sky and the reddish appearance of the Sun at the sunrise or sunset is due to
a)  Tyndall effect
b)  Autokinetic effect
c)  Bezold Effect
d)  Vertical-horizontal illusion
Answer: A
 The Vertical-horizontal illusion is the tendency for observers to overestimate the length of a vertical line relative to a horizontal line of the same length.
Bezold effect is an apparent change of tone of a colour due to the alteration of the
colour of the background.
The autokinetic effect, or autokinesis, occurs when a stationary image appears to move.
Since, the scattering of light (also known as Tyndall effect) that causes these illusions (blue sky, red sunset/sunrise) none of the above 3 are correct. So, options (b), (c) and (d) are incorrect.
The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light.
Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.

21 Which of the following are Rabi crops?
1.  Mustard
2.  Groundnut
3.  Gram
4.  Maize
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  3 and 4 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: D
Groundnut and maize are Kharif crops. So, statements 2 and 4 are wrong.
 India has three cropping seasons - rabi, kharif and zaid.
Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Some of the important rabi crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and mustard.
Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September-October. Important crops grown during this season are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and soyabean.

22 Which of the following states is/are the major producer(s) of pulses in India?
1.  Uttarakhand
2.  Mizoram
3.  Madhya Pradesh
4.  Kerala
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: B
 Pulses were in news recently due to price hike, hence the question.
Hardly any pulses are grown in Uttarakhand, Mizoram and other NE states (except Assam), Kerala, HP and J&K. MP is leading producer of pulses alongwith Maharashtra, UP and Rajasthan. So, statements 1, 2 and 4 are incorrect and only 3 is correct.
Other important pulse growing states are Karnataka and AP. In all other states pulse production is comparatively lower.
 Some pulses are grown in Kharif and some in rabi season. Being leguminous crops, all these crops except arhar help in restoring soil fertility by
fixing nitrogen from the air. Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation with other
crops.
Major pulses that are grown in India are tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and gram.

23 The following species (in increasing order of the food web) consume the produce of an agricultural field where pesticides are used heavily.
1.  Rats
2.  Mongoose
3.  Humans
The concentration of pesticides in them will be highest to lowest in the order?
a)  3>2>1
b)  1>2>3
c)  2>3>1
d)  1>3>2
Answer: A
  The food web goes in this order, rats>Mongoose>Humans.
Pesticides are either washed down into the soil or into the water bodies. From the soil, these are absorbed by the plants along with water and minerals, and from the water bodies these are taken up by aquatic plants and animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.
As these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated progressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top level
in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals get accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological magnification.

24 The initial objective of the 'Gramdan movement' was to
a)  Consolidate and secure landholdings of small and marginal farmers village- wise
b)  Improve collectivisation in rural agriculture
c)  Promote patronization of one village by one royal family
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
  The initial objective of the movement started by Vinoba Bhave was to secure voluntary donations of land and distribute it to the landless, but the movement soon came out with a demand of 1/6 share of land from all land owners. In 1952, the movement had widened the concept of gramdan (village in gift) and had started advocating commercial ownership of land. The first village to come under gramdan was Mangroth in Hamirpur Dist of U.P.
However, many land-owners chose to provide some part of their land to the poor farmers due to the fear of land ceiling act. This Bhoodan-Gramdan movement initiated by Vinobha Bhave is also known as the Blood-less Revolution.

25 Which of the following measures, generally invoked by the government, help contain price rise in certain food commodities?
1.  Invoking Essential Commodities Act
2.  Zero export duty on those food crops
3.  Promoting futures and forward trading in those food commodities to
4.  stabilize food prices
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: D
 Invoking essential commodities act against hoarding traders and stockists reduces hoarding, and increases supply in the market thus reducing prices. Statement 1 is correct.
Prices rise when production falls short of demand. Zero duty on exports would further reduce domestic supply. So, statement 2 is incorrect.
Futures and forward trading in times of price rise further destabilizes food prices by speculation. Government recently suspended such trading in view of rising pulse prices. So, statement 3 is incorrect.
 Commodities markets have flourished wherever producers and consumers have to exchange goods. This has happened for centuries; however somewhere in this process the agreements were signed by the parties where the delivery of a good was to be done in the future at a price which was decided in the present.
Hence payment was done after receiving the commodity in the given quantity and at the specified quality at the price negotiated earlier. This allowed the producers like a farmer to plant the crops with a guarantee that he would get a given price for the
crop and it gave the customer a security that he will get the requisite crop at the specified quantity and quality. This removed the losses incurred by either party because of variations in the market.
So, a forward contract is a non-standardized agreement between two parties to buy or sell a commodity or an asset at a future date at the
price decided now. A futures contract is similar with the difference being that the assets bought or sold are standardized and the contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange which acts as an intermediary.

26 Genetic engineering can NOT be performed with respect to
1.  Virus
2.  Clonal bacteria
3.  Fungi
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the options (a), (b) or (c) is correct.
Answer: D
 Genetically engineered viruses are being developed that can still confer immunity. So, statement 1 can't be the answer.
A clonal colony or genet is a group of genetically identical individuals, such as plants, fungi, or bacteria. Since genetic engineering can be done with bacteria, it can also be done with clonal bacteria. Statement 2 can't be the answer.
Filamentous fungi are widely used in biotechnology as cell factories for the production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. Statement 3 also can't be the answer.
So, none of the options is correct.
 Genetic engineering is any process by which genetic material (the building blocks of heredity) is changed in such a way as to make possible the production of new substances or new functions. As an example, biologists have now learned how to transplant the gene that
produces light in a firefly into tobacco plants. The function of that gene-the production of light-has been added to the normal list of functions of the tobacco plants.
In 1972 Paul Berg created the first recombinant DNA molecules by combining DNA
from the monkey virus SV40 with that of the lambda virus.
The first GMOs were bacteria generated in 1973 and GM mice in 1974. Insulin- producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982 and genetically modified food has been sold since 1994.

27 In India, movement from traditional crops to crop diversification especially cash crops can offer which of the following advantages?
1.  Earning foreign exchange
2.  Boost food processing industry
3.  Tackle problem of land degradation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
Crop diversification and also the growing of large number of crops are practiced in rainfed lands to reduce the risk factor of crop failures due to drought or less rains. Fruits, medicinal herbs, flowers, vegetables, bio-diesel crops like jatropha and jojoba need much less irrigation than rice or sugarcane. So, statement 3 is correct.
There is huge demand for cash crops abroad. For e.g. India exports 80% of the coffee it produces earning precious foreign exchange. Statement 1 is correct.
Processing of cops like tobacco, cotton, jute, cashew etc are generating large forward and backward linkages in the food processing industry. Statement 2 is correct.

28 The toothpaste, that you use daily, contains which of the following minerals to fight cavities?
a)  Petroleum Jelly
b)  Anatase
c)  Titanium Oxide
d)  Fluoride
Answer: D
  Abrasive minerals like silica, limestone, aluminium oxide and various phosphate minerals do the cleaning in the toothpaste that you use.
Fluoride is used to reduce cavities. It comes from a mineral fluorite. Most toothpastes are made white with titanium oxide, which comes from minerals called rutile, ilmenite and anatase.
The sparkle in some toothpastes comes from mica. The toothbrush and tube containing the paste are made of plastics from petroleum.

29 Consider the following with reference to 'Indentured labours'?
1.  It was in practice before the institution of 'slavery' started in Africa.
2.  It was abolished following the French Revolution.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 It started after the abolition of slavery. So, 1 is wrong.
It was widely employed in the 18th century in the British colonies in North America and elsewhere, and was not abolished after the French revolution. So, 2 is also incorrect.
Indentured labour was a system of bonded labour that was instituted following the abolition of slavery. Indentured labour were recruited to work on sugar, cotton and tea plantations, and rail construction projects in British colonies in West Indies, Africa and South East Asia. From 1834 to the end of the WWI, Britain had transported about 2 million Indian indentured workers to 19 colonies including Fiji, Mauritius, Ceylon, Trinidad, Guyana, Malaysia, Uganda, Kenya and South Africa.
The indentured workers (known derogatively as 'coolies') were recruited from India, China and from the Pacific and signed a contract in their own countries to work abroad for a period of 5 years or more. They were meant to receive wages, a small amount of land and in some cases, promise of a return passage once their contract was over. In reality, this seldom happened, and the conditions were harsh and their wages low.

30 Mica is one of the most important minerals used in electric and electronic industries due to its
1.  Low power loss factor
2.  Breakdown at high voltage to protect circuits
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Mica dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat, and hence has a low power loss factor. So, statement 1 is correct.
In fact, Mica is unique in being a good thermal conductor as well as an insulator. Mica also has excellent di-electric strength. It means that it can withstand high
voltages, which is why it is used in electric circuits. So, statement 2 is wrong.
 Mica sheets are chemically inert, dielectric, elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, platy, reflective, refractive, resilient, and range in opacity from transparent to opaque. Mica is stable when exposed to electricity, light, moisture, and extreme temperatures.
It is thus used in a situation where combination of high-heat stability and electrical properties is required.

31 Mining in a large area can have which of the following environmental impacts?
1.  Soil erosion
2.  Contamination of groundwater
3.  Poisoning and loss of nearby aquatic biodiversity
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
  Mining industry can impact aquatic biodiversity through different ways. Direct poisoning is the first one, and risks are higher when contaminants are mobile in the sediment or bioavailable in the water. Mine drainage can modify water pH. Metal oxide deposition can limit biomass by coating algae or
their substrate, thereby preventing colonization. So, statement 3 is correct.
The water sources in the region get contaminated due to mining. Dumping of waste and slurry leads to degradation of land, soil, and increase in stream and river pollution and leaches to groundwater too. So, statement 2 is correct.

32 In the technique of Vegetative Propagation
a)  Multiple plants are involved to produce a progeny
b)  Only one plant is involved in creating an offspring
c)  Artificial breeding is done through pollination
d)  Genes of particular plant species are preserved for progenies
Answer: B
  Vegetative propagation is a form of asexual reproduction of a plant. Only one plant is involved and the offspring is the result of one parent. The new plant is genetically identical to the parent.
Some of the methods used are:
Cuttings: Cuttings are part of the plant that is cut off of the parent plant. Shoots with leaves attached are usually used. New roots and leaves will grow from the cutting. The shoot is cut at an angle. A growth promoter may be used to help with the
growth of the roots.
Grafting: In grafting 2 plants are used to develop a new plant with combined traits from the 2 parent plants. In grafting the scion is the above ground part of one plant. The scion is attached to the stock which is the rooted part of the second plant.
Layering:In layering a shoot of a parent plant is bent until it can be covered by soil. The tip of the shoot remains above ground. New roots and eventually a new plant will grow. These plants can then be separated.

33 Apart from body mass, "Body mass Index (BMI)" for an adult is calculated using her/his
1.  Age
2.  Daily calorie intake

3.  Height
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: C
  One way to find out if adults are undernourished is to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).
Take the weight of the person in kg. Then take the height in metres. Divide the weight by the square of the height. If this figure is less than 18.5 then the person would be considered undernourished. However, if this BMI is more than 25, then a person is overweight. Do remember that this criterion is not applicable to growing children.

34 Consider the following with reference to natural gas and crude oil in India.
1.  India is a net importer of crude oil.
2.  India is a net exporter of petroleum products.
3.  Natural gas pricing in India has been deregulated.
4.  No upstream activities are done in these sectors in India presently.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: A
  Despite being a net importer of crude oil, India has become a net exporter of petroleum products by investing in refineries designed for export, particularly in Gujarat. So, statement 1 and 2 are correct.
Natural gas is priced based on a formula approved by the government which links prices to select global market prices. So, statement 3 is incorrect.
The oil and gas industry is usually divided into three major sectors: upstream, midstream and downstream. The upstream oil sector is also commonly known as the exploration and production (E&P) sector, which
is being done in India by companies such as Reliance and Cairn India. Statement 4 is incorrect.

35 The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) is responsible for conducting nation- wide surveys on various socio-economic aspects. It comes under
a)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
b)  Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation
c)  Ministry of Home Affairs
d)  Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)
Answer: B
It is the largest organization conducting socio-economic surveys in India.
Its nation-wide surveys on various socio-economic aspects include follow-up enterprise surveys of Economic Census, field work relating to Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), supervision of area enumeration and crop estimation surveys conducted by state agencies under the Improvement of Crop Statistics scheme, Urban Frame Survey with a view to prepare a frame of compact units of urban areas as the first stage sampling units (FSUs), organizing methodological studies and pilot surveys on important subjects and collection of price data from rural and urban sectors.
The organisation functions under the overall direction of a Governing Council with requisite independence and autonomy in the matter of collection, processing and publication of National Sample Survey (NSS) data.

36 Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) or Geo-exchange Pumps work on the principle of
a)  Dalton's law of partial pressure
b)  Refrigeration cycle
c)  Heat Doppler Effect
d)  Electromagnetic induction
Answer: B
 The description of geo-exchange pumps will clarify the concept and why (b) should be the answer.
Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP's) use the earth's relatively constant temperature (instead of the outside air) between 16 - 240C at a depth of 20 feet to provide heating, cooling, and hot water for homes and commercial buildings. GSHP harvests heat absorbed at the Earth's surface from solar energy.
The basic principle on which the GSHP works is "refrigeration cycle". The refrigerant carries the heat from one "space" to another. The heat pump's process can be reversed. The earth is the main source and sink of heat. In winters, it provides
heat and summers it takes the heat.

37 Aerobic rice cultivation
1.  Increases water use in rice production
2.  Is grown in water-saturated soils
3.  Can be done using any variety of rice grown in India
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Unlike flooded rice, irrigation-when applied-is not'used to flood the soil but to just bring the soil water'content in the root zone up to field capacity. So, it actually reduces water consumption and field is not flooded or saturated. Statement
1 and 2 are wrong.
Aerobic rice is a production system in which especially developed "aerobic rice" varieties are grown. So, statement 3 is also wrong.
 Soil is left properly aerated (oxygen) in this type of cultivation. This is the main difference with flooded rice cultivation. Aerobic rice can be found, or can
be a suitable technology, in the following areas:
a)  "Favorable uplands": these are areas where the land is flat, and where rainfall with or without supplemental irrigation is sufficient to frequently bring the soil water content close to field capacity, and where farmers have access to external inputs such as fertilizers.
b)  Fields on upper slopes or terraces in undulating, rainfed lowlands: quite often, soils in these areas are relatively coarse-textured and well-drained, so that ponding of water occurs only briefly or not at all during the growing season.
c)  Water-short irrigated lowlands: these are areas where farmers do not have access to sufficient water anymore to keep rice fields flooded for a substantial
period of time.

38 Hypertension is a growing Non-communicable (NCD) disease in India. Which of the following can lead to hypertension?
1.  Obesity
2.  High protein diet
3.  Old age
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
 Hypertension is a case of high blood pressure.
Blood pressure is the measure of the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. The heart pumps blood into the arteries (blood vessels), which carry the blood throughout the body.
Hypertension is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood out to the body and contributes to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, to stroke, kidney disease, and to the development of heart failure.
The exact causes of high blood pressure are not known, but several factors and conditions may play a role in its development, including:
Smoking; Being overweight or obese; Lack of physical activity; Too much salt in the diet; Too much alcohol consumption (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day); Stress; Older age; Genetics; Family history of high blood pressure; Chronic kidney disease; Adrenal and thyroid disorders; Sleep apnea.

39 In recent years, there is a tendency for the mills to shift from northern states and concentrate in the southern and western states, especially in Maharashtra. This is because
1.  Cane produced there has higher sucrose content
2.  Cooler climate ensures a longer crushing season
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
  Statement 2: In southern India, hot winds do not blow in summer, and there is no frost in winter. Moreover, they are closer to sea which exerts its moderating influence. This makes for an ideal location for growing sugarcane.
Statement 1: For best productivity, sugarcane needs tropical conditions such as long hours of sunshine, cool nights with clear skies. This is reason, that highest productivity in terms of sugar content is found in Maharashtra sugarcane.
Moreover, cooperative movements are more successful in these regions, which is one more reason for the shift.

41 Which of the following can be produced with sugarcane plants?
1.  Molasses
2.  Alcohol
3.  Bagasse
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical energy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give alcohol (ethanol). So, 1 and 2 are correct.
Other products derived from sugarcane include sugar, falernum, rum, cacha'a (a traditional spirit from Brazil) and bagasse. So, 3 is correct.
In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch.
Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a cleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient air (oxygen).

42 Which of the following describes Cryonics most appropriately?
a)  Study of the production and behaviour of materials at very low temperatures
b)  Applications of solid frozen fuels in space flights
c)  Cryopreservation of humans and animals with the intention of future revival
d)  Genetic engineering done at very low temperatures
Answer: C
 Cryogenic and Cryonics are two different things. Option (a) and (b)
are related to cryogenics.
(c) describes cryonics.
Future revival in Cryonics is done because it is believed humans and animals can be kept alive until in the future a medicine discovery cures them.
A central premise of cryonics is that long-term memory, personality, and identity are stored in durable cell structures and patterns within the brain that do not require continuous brain activity to survive
The central premises of Cryonics are:
Life can be stopped and restarted if its basic structure is preserved. For e.g. Human embryos are routinely preserved for years at temperatures that completely stop the chemistry of life.
Vitrification (not freezing) can preserve biological structure very well. For e.g. Adding high concentrations of chemicals called cryoprotectants to cells permits tissue to be cooled to very low temperatures with little or no ice formation
Methods for repairing structure at the molecular level can now be foreseen. For e.g. the emerging science of nanotechnology will eventually lead to devices capable of extensive tissue repair and regeneration (to correct the damages caused due to vitrification).

organisations from over 115 countries.

45 What is the significance of recent formation of ASEAN Economic Community?
1.  ASEAN will become a single market.
2.  It will adopt a single currency.
3.  While fiscal policies will be different for member nations, monetary policy will be the same for each nation.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  3 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
  AEC would make ASEAN a single market with a free flow of goods, capital and skilled labour in the region.
It would thus integrate Southeast Asia's diverse 10 economies which has combine population of 620 million people and a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of
2.4 trillion US dollars.
To achieve this, it would abolish tariffs on imports within the bloc member countries and promote the liberalization of service industries such as retailing and tourism.
Hence, it calls for more free movement of and skilled labour within the region including of doctors, architects and others with special skills.
Statement 2 and 3 are not valid for ASEAN, but valid for EU.

46 Litmus can be extracted from
a)  Rhizobium
b)  Mycorrhizae
c)  Lichens
d)  Corals
Answer: C
  Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from
lichen, a plant belonging to the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple.
There are many other natural materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.

49 You observe a fire nearby your house with lots of black smoke and a dazzling yellow flame. The fire has been caused most likely due to the burning of?
a)  Vegetable oil that is used for cooking
b)  A large propane cylinder
c)  A natural gas pipeline
d)  Any of the above
Answer: A
 Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while unsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of black
smoke.
Vegetable oil is normally unsaturated oil, i.e. if it burns it gives black smoke and yellow flame.
Propane and natural gas (mostly methane) are saturated hydrocarbons (single bond carbon chains). So they give a clear flame.

51 Which of the following is/are NOT the objective(s) of National Forest Policy, 1988?
1.  Checking soil erosion and denudation in the catchment areas of rivers.
2.  Checking the extension of sand-dunes in the desert areas and along the coastal tracts
3.  Meeting the requirements of forest produce of the rural and tribal populations.
4.  . Creating a massive people's movement with the involvement of women to achieve the objectives of the policy
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  All are objectives of National Forest Policy.
Answer: D
 : First look tells you that a policy cannot talk about a massive people's movement. But, this policy does. Also, the policy is all inclusive as it does not talk only about arresting deforestation and countering its adverse effects, it goes beyond to maintain the livelihoods of the communities that inhabit the forests. So, all statements are correct.
: Other basic objectives are:
Maintenance of environmental stability through preservation and, where necessary, restoration of the ecological balance that has been adversely disturbed by serious depletion of the forests of the country.
Conserving the natural heritage of the country by preserving the remaining natural forests with the vast variety of flora and fauna, which represent the remarkable biological diversity and genetic resources of the country. Increasing substantially the forest/tree cover in the country through massive afforestation and social forestry programmes, especially on all denuded, degraded and unproductive lands.
Increasing the productivity of forests to meet essential national needs. Encouraging efficient utilisation of forest produce and maximising substitution of wood.

52 Recently in Mumbai (2015) a lot of people fell ill after drinking contaminated alcohol and some died of it as a result. The 'contamination' was most probably due to?
a)  Hydrogen Cyanide
b)  Agent Orange
c)  Methanol
d)  Ethanol
Answer: C
Ethanol is basically alcohol. It is not very harmful in the short-term if not taken in very large quantities. So, (d) is wrong.
Hydrogen Cyanide is a powerful toxicant. It is not mixed with alcohol at any stage its preparation. (a) is wrong.
Agent Orange was used during the Vietnam War, both to kill the trees which provided cover for enemy soldiers, and to destroy crops in rural areas. (b) is wrong.
: Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol is oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of cells. It causes the protoplasm to get coagulated, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by cooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness.
Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced for industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances like methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be identified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.

53 Under the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme, NABARD gives grant support to which of the following agencies?
1.  Individual Rural Volunteers (IRV)
2.  NGOs
3.  Private Commercial banks
4.  Farmers Clubs
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  3 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  1, 2 and 4 only
Answer: D
Ever since the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme was launched by
NABARD, the Self Help Promoting Agencies such as NGOs, Banks (RRBs,
DCCBs), Farmers Clubs and Individual Rural Volunteers (IRV) are being extended grant support to organise and nurture SHGs of the poor.
In fact, the phenomenal growth of SHG-Bank Linkage Programme in the country, is the result of the painstaking efforts put in by these agencies in forming and nurturing SHGs especially in areas where the concept never existed.
Check the lumpsum grant support given by NABARD to these agencies.

54 Wind, running water, biological activities contribute to the formation of soil. Which of the following do NOT contribute to the 'formation' of soil?
1.  Glaciers
2.  Magma
3.  Groundwater
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  3 only
Answer: D
Glacial movements erode a very large portion of earth and deposit them slowly over a place where other forces of nature act on it to form soil. So, 1 contributes.
Magma is responsible for formation of lava and its cooling forms igneous soil. So, 2 contributes.
Groundwater does not form soil as such but it can cause salination of soil if is withdrawn excessively. In areas of limestone, it forms landforms, but not soil. So, 3 does not contribute.
 : All soils initially come from rocks, this is termed the 'parent material'. The Parent Material may be directly below the soil, or great distances away if wind, water or glaciers have transported the soil.
In addition to the soil parent material, soil formation is also dependent upon climatic conditions like temperature, humidity etc. These affect both the form and rate of physical and chemical weathering of the parent material.
The formation of soils can be seen as a combination of the products of weathering,
of structural development of the soil, of differentiation of that structure into horizons or layers, and lastly of its movement or translocation.

55 Maximum land area has been degraded and converted to wasteland in India under the influence of
a)  Overblowing of wind
b)  Mining and Industrial waste
c)  Waterlogging and surface ponding
d)  Water erosion
Answer: D
  The image below is based on a preliminary study of ICAR, but results will nearly be the same. Data in NCERT is old (2000) and thus may not be reliable. The report can be found here
http://icar.org.in/files/Degraded-and-Wastelands.pdf(Page 6)
Major factors are loss of top-soil due to water erosion; land degradation due to acidity; vegetal degradation with water erosion; and gully formation.

56 Autotrophic Nutrition is mainly associated with
a)  Fungi
b)  Protozoa
c)  Algae
d)  Viruses
Answer: C
 Simple, straightforward question.
Autotrophs manufacture their own food. Most known example is plants which fulfil their carbon and energy requirements by photosynthesis.
Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that
produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.
Fungi, Protozoa and Virus do not manufacture food. So, (a), (b) and (d) are wrong.

57 The National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) is a subordinate office under
a)  Ministry of Heavy Industry and Enterprises
b)  Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
c)  Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)
d)  Ministry of Law and Justice
Answer: B
: The National Common Minimum Programme had identified the need to have a continuing forum consisting of representatives from Government, the Industry and the Academia for policy dialogue to energize and sustain the growth of the manufacturing industry
The National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) has been set up by the Government under DIPP, Ministry of Commerce to provide a continuing forum for policy dialogue to energise and sustain the growth of manufacturing industries in India. The NMCC is expected to suggest various ways and means for enhancing the competitiveness of manufacturing sector including identification of manufacturing sectors which have potential for global competitiveness.
The Government also nominated Members of the Council who are from various fields of industry.

58 Which of the following statements is correct about black soil?
a)  It is generally rich in phosphoric contents.
b)  It is made up of very coarse material.
c)  It can hold moisture.
d)  It is formed after the weathering of metamorphic rocks over a long period of time.
Answer: C
: These soils are generally poor in phosphoric contents. So, (a) is wrong. It is however rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.
The black soils are made up of extremely fine i.e. clayey material. They are well- known for their capacity to hold moisture. So, (b) is wrong, and (c) is correct.
It is typical of the Deccan trap (Basalt) region spread over northwest Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows. So, (d) is wrong.
It is also known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for growing cotton and is also known as black cotton soil.
It covers the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and extend in the south east direction along the Godavari and the Krishna valleys.

59 As per State of Forest Report published in India, which of the following is correct in order of lowest to highest area?
a)  Open forests, Mangroves, Dense Forests, Plantations
b)  Mangroves, Open forests, Dense Forests
c)  Dense forests, Plantations, Mangroves, Open forests
d)  Mangroves, Dense Forests, Open forests, Plantations
Answer: B
  : The table (image) below gives the details as per State of Forest Report 2013.
The forest cover includes all lands which have a tree canopy density of 10 percent and above and have a minimum area of one hectare.
The forest cover reported in the ISFR does not make any distinction between the origins of forest stand (whether natural or man-made) or tree species and encompasses all types of lands irrespective of their ownership, land use and legal status.
Thus, all tree species along with bamboos, fruit bearing trees, coconut, palm, etc. and all areas including forest, private, community or institutional lands meeting the above defined criteria have been termed as forest cover.

60 Plant tissue culture or Micropropagation is
1.  Used to produce clones of a plant
2.  Performed in the wild
3.  Used to conserve rare or endangered plant species
Select the correct answr using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
  : It is performed under sterile conditions in a nutrient culture medium (laboratory conditions). So, 2 is incorrect.
Plant tissue culture relies on the fact that many plant cells have the ability to regenerate a whole plant.
Plant tissue culture is used widely in the plant sciences, forestry, and in horticulture. Applications include:
To quickly produce mature plants.
The production of multiples of plants in the absence of seeds or necessary pollinators to produce seeds.
The regeneration of whole plants from plant cells that have been genetically modified
The production of plants from seeds that otherwise have very low chances of germinating and growing, i.e.: orchids and Nepenthes.
To clean particular plants of viral and other infections and to quickly multiply these plants as 'cleaned stock' for horticulture and agriculture.
The commercial production of plants used as potting, landscape, and florist subjects, which uses meristem and shoot culture to produce large numbers of identical individuals

61 Which of the following are the qualities of high grade coal?
1.  Softness
2.  High moisture content
3.  High carbon content
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: A
  : Lignite is a low grade brown coal, which is soft with high moisture content.
Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased temperatures is bituminous coal.
Metallurgical coal is high grade bituminous coal which has a special value for smelting iron in blast furnaces.
Anthracite is the highest quality hard coal.
So, a high grade coal should be hard with less moisture and greater carbon content, and not the opposite. So, statement 1 and 2 are wrong.

62 You are leading a team which is heading to forests in the night to look for survivors using a search-light. You have the following options for choosing the mirror to be used in the search light:
1.  Convex mirror
2.  Plane mirror
3.  Cylindrical mirror
4.  Parabolic concave mirrors
Which of the above will you choose and why?
a)  Convex mirror as it could generate parallel beams of light
b)  Plane mirror as it can act as a good reflector
c)  Parabolic concave mirrors as it could generate powerful parallel beams of light
d)  Cylindrical mirrors as light could be focussed on one point
Answer: C
  : Concave mirrors, are used in vehicle headlights, searchlights etc to send parallel rays because it allows the light rays to be focused as a single beam and give more power to the light, that makes it more efficient for seeing and to be seen by others.
If the mirror was not concave the light would be scattered which wastes energy and reduces efficiency. So, (c) is correct.
For this, the source of light is placed at the focus of the concave reflector.
They are often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The dentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients. Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce heat in solar furnaces.

63 The Schedule I and II of Indian Widlife Protection Act 1972 is concerned with
a)  List of wild animals whose hunting is to be permitted in certain cases
b)  Constitution of the National Wildlife Board
c)  List of activities hazardous to wildlife inside a protected area
d)  Providing protection to a list of species
Answer: D
Schedule I and II of the act are frequently in news coverage and also covered in past year UPSC questions.
The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants; and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.
It extends to the whole of India, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir which has its own wildlife act.
It has six schedules which give varying degrees of protection.
Schedule I and part II of Schedule II provide absolute protection - offences under these are prescribed the highest penalties
Species listed in Schedule III and Schedule IV are also protected, but the penalties are much lower.
Schedule V includes the animals which may be hunted. The plants in Schedule VI
are prohibited from cultivation and planting

64 Apparent random wavering of air above a barbeque fire is due to
a)  Atmospheric refraction
b)  Dispersion of light above the fire
c)  Air parcels become lighter and start moving upwards
d)  Scattering of air particles
Answer: A
 Dispersion divides light into 7 colours which is not the case here. (b)
is thus wrong.
Air parcels don't actually move much, even if they do, the 'apparant' flickering is not due to this. It is because of the way light is refracted across warm and cold air packets. (b) is wrong.
This is from your NCERT, 'You might have observed the apparent random wavering or flickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air rising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes hotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly less than that of the cooler air.
Since the physical conditions of the refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent position of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates. This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction of light by the earth's atmosphere) on a small scale in our local environment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on a much larger scale.
The apparent flattening of the Sun's disc at sunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.'

65 Commercial farming always differs from subsistence farming in
1.  Selection of crops
2.  Use of modern agricultural inputs
3.  Farm size
4.  Sale of farm produce in market
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  1, 2 and 4 only
c)  2, 3 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
: Rice is a commercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but in Orissa, it is a subsistence crop. Selection of crops can be the same in both types of farming, technique is what essentially differs. Statement 1 is thus wrong
Farm size must be small in subsistence farming as the farmer has to feed a single family only. In commercial farming, produce is to sold in the market, so farms must be large and economically viable. So, statements 3 and 4 are correct.
The main characteristic of commercial farming is the use of higher doses of modern inputs, e.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order to obtain higher productivity. The degree of commercialisation of agriculture varies from one region to another.

66 The drastic decline in the Gharial population over the last 60 years can be attributed to
1.  Over-hunting for skin
2.  Heat pollution of water
3.  Discharge of industrial effluents
4.  Egg collection for consumption
5.  Killing for indigenous medicine
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2 and 3 only
b)  3, 4 and 5 only
c)  1, 4 and 5 only
d)  2, 3 and 4 only
Answer: C
No study cites heat pollution of water and industrial effluents as a problem for Gharial population. So, statement 2 and 3 are also not appropriate.
Below all the major causes are listed. It has been picked from IUCN's website.
Their population decline can be attributed to a variety of causes including over-hunting for skins and trophies, egg collection for consumption, killing for indigenous medicine, and killing by fishermen (for example: Biswas 1970 and Whitaker 1975).
While hunting is no longer considered to be a significant threat, the construction of
dams, barrages, irrigation canals, siltation, changes in river course, artificial embankments, sand-mining, riparian agriculture, and domestic and feral livestock have combined to cause an extreme limitation to gharial range due to this excessive, irreversible loss of riverine habitat.

67 Which of the following do NOT form part of a strategy of sustainable development?
a)  Relying more on organic farming
b)  Reducing the use of personal vehicles and promoting public transport
c)  Safeguarding the habitats of indigenous communities, flora and fauna
d)  Not compromising on the needs of the present generation with respect to future generations
Answer: D
Organic farming is more eco-friendly as it does not involve use of chemical fertilizers, weedicides, herbicides etc. So (a) is correct.
Reducing the use of private vehicles will reduce pollution. For e.g. No car day in
Delhi and Paris were organized recently. So, (b) is correct.
(c) means taking into account human as well as animal and plant biodiversity, which forms part of sustainable development. So, (c) is correct.
(d) goes against the idea of inter-generational equity. We should not compromise on the needs of the future generations against the present generation. So, it is the only incorrect option.
Sustainable development (SD) is a process for meeting human development goals while maintaining the ability of natural systems to continue to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend. Essentially we should not use more than nature can replenish.

69 The Source of Ocean Thermal Energy is
a)  Molten Magma at the base of Ocean
b)  Frictional force among the tides
c)  Plate movement near mid-oceanic ridges
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
  The water at the surface of the sea or ocean is heated by the Sun while the water in deeper sections is relatively cold. This difference in temperature is exploited to obtain energy in ocean-thermal-energy conversion plants.
These plants can operate if the temperature difference between the water at the surface and water at depths up to 2 km is 293 K (20C) or more. The warm surface- water is used to boil a volatile liquid like ammonia. The vapours of the liquid are then used to run the turbine of generator. The cold water from the depth of the ocean is pumped up and condense vapour again to liquid.
The energy potential from the sea (tidal energy, wave energy and ocean thermal energy) is quite large, but efficient commercial exploitation is difficult.

70 Which of the following statements about cultivation of Coffee in India is NOT correct?
1.  Kerala leads in production.
2.  Majority of production is exported.
3.  . India grows only inferior varieties of coffee.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: D
  Coffee production in India is dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with the state of Karnataka accounting 53% followed by Kerala 28% and Tamil Nadu 11% of production of 8,200 tonnes. So, statement 1 is wrong.
Indian coffee is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct
sunlight anywhere in the world. The two well known species of coffee grown are the
Arabica and Robusta. So, statement 3 is also incorrect.
Almost 80% of the country's coffee production is exported. Of that which is exported, 70% is bound for Germany, Russian federation, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, United States, Japan etc. So, statement 2 is correct.

There is no age limit for individuals. None of the Government official/individual is eligible for the award.'
Private companies are not eligible neither are ministries or departments. So, 2 and 3 are incorrect.

72 Manganese can be used in manufacturing
1.  Insecticides
2.  Paints
3.  Bleaching powder
4.  Atomic force microscopy
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 4 only
Answer: C
  Not, manganese, but sheet Mica is used for atomic force microscopy (a very high resolution of microscoping. So, statement 4 is wrong.
Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidatively neutralize the greenish tinge in glass caused by trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine, and in drying black paints.
Manganese is mainly used in the manufacturing of steel and ferro-manganese alloy. Nearly 10 kg of manganese is required to manufacture one tonne of steel.

73 Which of the following statements about alluvial soils (mainly found in Northern India)
is/are correct?
1.  . It has been deposited mainly by the peninsular river system.
2.  It cannot be found in drier states such as Rajasthan and Gujarat.
3.  Alluvial soil with fine particles is generally more fertile than with coarser particles.
4.  . It is always alkaline in nature.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 4 only
b)  1, 2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: C
It is deposited mainly by the three important Himalayan river systems. So, statement 1 is incorrect.
It can be found in Rajasthan and Gujarat, and eastern coastal plains as well. So, statement 2 is also incorrect.
Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline and can be productive after proper
treatment and irrigation. So, statement 4 is incorrect as alkalinity is not always the case. For e.g. brahmpaputra alluviam is acidic in nature.
 Apart from the size of their grains or components, soils are also described on the basis of their age. According to their age alluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial (Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar).
The bangar soil has higher concentration of kanker nodules than the Khadar. It has more fine particles and is more fertile than the bangar. Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.

74 Mining of manganese nodules can impact the environment by
1.  . Affecting deep sea ecosystems
2.  Resulting in release of carbon monoxide from sea beds
3.  . Causing deforestation
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: D
It is mined in deep sea surface. So, the question of deforestation does not arise. Statement 3 is incorrect.
It does not result in release in CO from sea beds. Some studies indicate that stored methane may be released on mining. So, statement 2 is also incorrect.
Polymetallic nodules (manganese nodules) are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. It mainly contains manganese, cobalt, nickel and copper.
Nodule mining could affect tens of thousands of square kilometers of deep sea ecosystems. Nodule regrowth takes decades to millions of years and that would make such mining an unsustainable and nonrenewable practice. Any prediction about the effects of mining is extremely uncertain. Thus, nodule mining could cause habitat alteration, direct mortality of benthic creatures (living near sea bed), or
suspension of sediment, which can smother filter feeders (suspension feeding animals). Future environmental impact studies should address the impact on disruption and release of methane clathrate deposits in the deep oceans.

75 World Development Indicators' report is published by
a)  World Bank
b)  United Nations Development Programme
c)  United Nations Economic and Social Council
d)  World Health Organization

World Development Indicators is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.

76 Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) indicates
a)  the number of children that die before the age of one year as a proportion of
1000 live children born in that particular year
b)  the total number of children under the age of five as a proportion of 1000 that take birth and die in a particular year
c)  Total number of children that die within 28 days of their birth as a proportion of 1000 in that particular year
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
Option (b) is known as Under 5 Mortality Rate (U5MR).
Option (c) describes neo-natal mortality rate. Option (a) describes IMR.
Presently the IMR of India is around 42 per 1000 births which also nearly fulfils the MDG criteria for IMR
IMR is dependent on several factors such as institutional delivery, sanitation, water, health facilities, early disease prevention, malnutrition of mother and child, educational levels of the mother and family etc.

77 Reserves of natural gas can NOT be found in
1.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands
2.  Lakshadweep
3.  Gulf of Cambay
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  2 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
  Large reserves of natural gas have been discovered in the Krishna- Godavari basin.
Along the west coast the reserves of the Mumbai High and allied fields are supplemented by finds in the Gulf of Cambay. Andaman and Nicobar islands are also important areas having large reserves of natural gas.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. (ONGC) is focusing on the unexplored deep waters of Andaman Nicobar basin, which lies between hydrocarbon producing fields in south Myanmar and northwest Indonesia.
It plans to launch a new exploration campaign to drill as many as 18 wells in six deepwater blocks in the Andaman basin with an estimated investment of about US
$1 billion.

78 Depletion of groundwater due to excessive withdrawal can have which of the following consequences?
1.  Increased costs of groundwater irrigation
2.  Land subsidence
3.  Saltwater intrusion in coastal areas
4.  Environmental degradation of nearby Ecotones
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 4 only
b)  1, 3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
  As the water table lowers, the water must be pumped farther to reach the surface, using more energy. In extreme cases, using such a well can be cost prohibitive. So, 1 is correct.
Land subsidence occurs when there is a loss of support below ground. This is most often caused by human activities, mainly from the overuse of groundwater, when the soil collapses, compacts, and drops. So, 2 is correct.
Saltwater intrusion is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers. The movement happens because saltwater has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher water pressure. As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater, which can lead to contamination of drinking water sources and other consequences. So, 3 is correct.
An ecotone is a transition area between two biomes. It is where two communities meet and integrate. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation, and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. Hyporheic zones (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater. So, 4 is correct.

79 Which of the following may generally indicate the development levels of a country?
1.  . Per capita income
2.  Average literacy level
3.  Status of Health indicators
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 A straightforward question.
Per capita income shows living standard and economic status. So, 1 is correct. Literacy rate shows educational achievement and is used in some form in the Human
Development Index (HDI). So, 2 is correct.
Health indicators like IMR, MMR, malnutrition rate etc. show the general health and well-being of the population and its life expectancy. So, 3 is correct.

80 Which of the statements regarding Monazite sands is correct?
1.  Monazite is radioactive due to the presence of thorium.
2.  It is a principle source of some rare earth metals.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
  Monazite is a reddish-brown phosphate mineral containing rare earth metals. It occurs usually in small isolated crystals. Lanthanum
is the most common rare earth element in monazite. So, statement 1 is correct.
Monazite is radioactive due to the presence of thorium and, less commonly, uranium. Because of its radioactive nature, monazite is a useful for radiometric dating of geological events, such as crystallization, heating, or deformation of the rocks containing monazite. So, statement 2 is also correct.
Thorium extracted from Monazite sands can be used for generation of nuclear power.

81 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country is
a)  Total value of tradable goods produced in a year
b)  Total value of monetary and non-monetary goods and services within a year
c)  Total value of economic transactions done within a country within a year
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Option (a) is wrong as GDP includes services too.
Option (b) is wrong as non-monetary goods and services (e.g. cooking by housewife) is not included in GDP calculation.
Option (c) is wrong as economic transactions virtually include everything economic in the country. For e.g. if a stock broker sells and purchases the same stock worth Rs. 1000 five times in a day, it does not increase the GDP of the country by Rs.
5000. Economic transactions may also include buying and selling of bonds, FII
inflows and outflows etc.
GDP includes the value of all goods and services produced within a country within a year.

82 Consider the following statements about Grameen Bank.
1.  It was found jointly by Nobel laureates Muhammad Yunus and Amartya Sen.
2.  It is a community development bank which provides loans to the poor
3.  without demanding collateral.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Grameen Bank (GB) has reversed conventional banking practice by removing the need for collateral (security against which a loan is made, e.g. house) and created a banking system based on mutual trust, accountability, participation and creativity.
Professor Muhammad Yunus, the founder of "Grameen Bank" and its Managing Director, reasoned that if financial resources can be made available to the poor people on terms and conditions that are appropriate and reasonable, "these millions of small people with their millions of small pursuits can add up to create the biggest development wonder.'
As of 2011, it has 8.349 million borrowers, 97 percent of whom are women. With
2,565 branches, GB provides services in 81,379 villages, covering more than 97 percent of the total villages in Bangladesh.

83 Money as a medium of exchange in India has been authorized by the
a)  Constitution of India
b)  Government of India
c)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)
d)  None of the above
Answer: B
  Money does not have any intrinsic value. However, it is still accepted as a medium of exchange because the currency is authorised by the government of the country. In India, the Reserve Bank of India issues currency notes on behalf of the central government.
As per Indian law, no other individual or organisation is allowed to issue currency. Moreover, the law legalises the use of rupee as a medium of payment that cannot be
refused in settling transactions in India. No individual in India can legally refuse a payment made in rupees. Hence, the rupee is widely accepted as a medium of exchange.

86 Which of the following is NOT a trade barrier?
a)  Import tariff
b)  Import Quota
c)  Subsidies
d)  WTO agreements
Answer: D
A barrier to trade is a government-imposed restraint on the flow of international goods or services.
The most common barrier to trade is a tariff'a tax on imports. Tariffs raise the price of imported goods relative to domestic goods (goods produced at home). Quota
reduces imports. So, (a) and (b) are trade barriers.
Another common barrier to trade is a government subsidy to a particular domestic industry. Subsidies make those goods cheaper to produce than in foreign markets. This results in a lower domestic price. Both tariffs and subsidies raise the price of foreign goods relative to domestic goods, which reduces imports. For e.g. subsidies on agriculture is a major point of contention in WTO. So, (c) is also a trade barrier.
WTO agreements bring uniformity in trade policies of countries and reduce trade barriers. So, (d) is the answer.

87 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are meant to
a)  Act as Export Processing Zones to promote exports
b)  Promote development of industrial townships in India
c)  Provide state of the art technological and research facilities to the domestic companies to remain competitive
d)  Create an industrial workforce by establishing agglomeration training centres
Answer: A
The term special economic zone (SEZ) is commonly used as a generic term to refer to any modern economic zone.
In these zones business and trades laws differ from the rest of the country. Broadly, SEZs are located within a country's national borders.
The aims of the zones include: increased trade, increased investment, job creation and effective administration. To encourage businesses to set up in the zone, financially libertarian policies are introduced. These policies typically regard investing, taxation, trading, quotas, customs and labour regulations. Additionally, companies may be offered tax holidays.

1.  It has been established at Union, State and District level.
2.  The commission is an executive body.
3.  The National commission is headed by a sitting or retired judge of the
4.  Supreme Court of India.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
 It is a quasi-judicial body. So, 2 is wrong.
The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is lays down the rights of the consumers and provides for promotion and protection of the rights of the consumers.
The Act mandates establishment of Consumer Protection Councils at the Centre as well as in each State and District, with a view to promoting consumer awareness.
The Central Council is headed by Minster, In-charge of the Department of
Consumer Affairs in the Central Government and the State Councils by the Minister
In-charge of the Consumer Affairs in the State Governments. It also provides for a
3-tier structure of the National and State Commissions and District Forums for speedy resolution of consumer disputes.
Each District Forum is headed by a person who is or has been or is eligible to be appointed as a District Judge and each State Commission is headed by a person who is or has been a Judge of High Court.

90 Chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen. Why?
a)  To protect the chips from carbon dioxide
b)  To increase the shelf life of chips
c)  To increase the nutritional value of chips.
d)  To make the chip bags lighter
Answer: B
Nitrogen being inert prevents rancidity ' the oxidation of fats and oils. When chip bags are flushed with nitrogen, it cuts off the supply of air and prevents oils and fats in the chips from getting oxidised.
Rancidity refers to the spoilage of a food in such a way that it becomes undesirable (and usually unsafe) for consumption. Most of the time rancidity can change the odors or flavors of a food in such a way that it becomes very unpleasant to smell or taste.
Oils can be especially susceptible to rancidity because their chemistry can make them exceptionally susceptible to oxygen damage. When food scientists talk about rancidity, they are often talking about a specific type of rancidity involving oxygen damage to foods, and this type of rancidity is called "oxidative rancidity." During the process of oxidative rancidity, oxygen molecules interact with the structure of the oil and damage its natural structure in a way that can change its odor, its taste, and its safety for consumption.

91 When wood or charcoal is ignited, it initially gives a flame, but later just glows red and
gives out heat without a flame. What can be the possible reason?
a)  The carbon content of the fuel becomes very small after burning them for some time
b)  After some time, the latent heat of vaporisation is crossed which douses the flame
c)  Flame is produced by solid sulphur which burns off after some time
d)  The gaseous volatile substances in them vaporise after some time
Answer: D
  The carbon content still remains after burning. So, (a) is wrong.
Latent heat of vaporisation has nothing to do here. (b) is wrong.
Flame is produced by gaseous volatile substances, not solid ones. So, (c) is wrong.
A candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However, you will observe the coal or charcoal in an 'angithi' sometimes just glows red and gives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous substances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present vapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.

The South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program brings together Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in a project- based partnership that aims to promote regional prosperity, improve economic opportunities, and build a better quality of life for the people of the sub-region.
SASEC seeks to strengthen multimodal cross-border transport networks that boost intraregional trade and open up trade opportunities with East and Southeast Asia. The program helps build modern and effective customs administrations that speed up the time and reduce the costs of moving goods, vehicles, and people across borders. The six SASEC
countries presently remain some of the least economically integrated in the world. SASEC also assists member countries in improving energy security by developing
infrastructure and promoting intraregional power trade to reduce costs and import
dependence.

96 A very small amount of baking soda is added to fresh milk. Why?
a)  To disinfect the curd from viruses
b)  To avoid the oxidation of milk for longer periods of time
c)  To prevent the milk from turning to curd for longer periods
d)  To separate the water content of milk
Answer: C
 Curd is formed under acidic conditions. When baking soda is added
to milk, it turns more alkaline and less acidic. In a more alkaline medium, curd does not set easily.
 Baking soda or sodium bicarbonate can be administered to pools, spas, and garden ponds to raise pH levels.
It has weak disinfectant properties, and it may be an effective fungicide against some organisms
Sodium bicarbonate can be used to extinguish small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide.

97 Consider the following statements about "Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction"?
1.  It was adopted by UN Member States in 2015.
2.  It is the successor instrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFa) 2005-2015
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
 The framework was one of the important points to be discussed at the second World Congress on Disaster Management (WCDM) being held recently in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
The Sendai Framework is a 15-year, voluntary, non-binding agreement which recognizes that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders including local government, the private sector and other stakeholders.
The Sendai Framework was adopted by UN Member States on 18 March 2015 at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.

98 Which of the following is the competent authority in India to declare a specific district as drought-hit?
a)  Union Cabinet
b)  State Government
c)  District Magistrate
d)  Divisional Commissioner
Answer: B
 The criteria to declare drought also depends on the state government.
For e.g. Maharashtra government came up with a proposal to declare drought if an area receives less than 50% of average rainfall. Earlier criteria was around 75%.
An All-India drought is declared by the Union Cabinet.
When the rainfall for the monsoon season of June to September for the country as a whole is within 10% of its long period average, it is categorised as a normal monsoon. When the monsoon rainfall deficiency exceeds 10%, it is categorised as an all-India drought year.
