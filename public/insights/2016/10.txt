1 It has been suggested that we should plant eucalyptus trees for arresting ecological degradation. This is because
1.  These trees absorb wastewater and release pure water vapour into the atmosphere.
2.  They can be used for phytoremediation of soil polluted with heavy metals.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: Growing eucalyptus along sewage ponds absorbs all surplus wastewater. It is said that these trees are thirsty of water and guzzle a lot of water. The waste water is utilized for tree growth which then could yield fuelwood, helping in many ways. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: When grown using wastewater, eucalyptus plantations can remove toxic metals, since the trees are known to sequester, tolerate and accumulate high levels of various heavy metals. So, 2 is correct.

2 The Upanishads talk about finding out "the nature of the Self". The "Self" here refers to
a)  Personality of human beings
b)  Human body and mind
c)  Human Ego
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 The Upanishads tell us that the core of our own self is not the body, or the mind, but atman or "Self". It is neither the ego. So, (a), (b) and (c) are all wrong.
Atman is the core of all creatures, their innermost essence. It can only be perceived by direct experience through meditation. It is when we are at the deepest level of our existence.
As per the Upanishads, "Brahman is the one underlying substance of the universe, the unchanging "Absolute Being", the intangible essence of the entire existence."
When a person achieves moksha (liberation), their atman (self) returns to brahman
(the source), like a drop of water returning to the ocean.

3 Aurora are multicoloured lights that appear in the upper atmosphere over the Polar
Regions and visible from locations in the middle and high latitudes. They are caused by
a)  The interaction of solar wind with oxygen and nitrogen gas in the atmosphere.
b)  Variation of Sunspots along with magnetic activity of the earth
c)  Reflection of gases and ions in the stratosphere
d)  Reaction of ozone with nitrogen in upper troposphere
Answer: A
 The Aurora is an incredible light show caused by collisions between electrically charged particles released from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere and collide with gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.
The Aurora is an incredible light show caused by collisions between electrically charged particles released from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere and collide with gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.
Aurora in the Northern Hemisphere are called aurora borealis and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere.

4 The Lokayatas believed in
1.  Afterlife exists and humans carry karmic debt.
2.  Human body is made of elements like water and air.
3.  An eternal consciousness permeates the Universe and the human beings.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: B
 Lokayatas are also known as the materialists.
As per them, "A human being is made up of the four elements. When he dies the earthy in him returns to the earth, the fluid to water, the heat to fire, the windy to air, and his senses pass into space." So, 2 is correct.
As per them, there is no this world or that world or this life or that life. What exists is only what can be seen here and now. So, Consciousness, God, Karma, rebirth, incarnation etc do not exist and are mere fallacies. So, 1 and 3 would be incorrect.

5 How are plants that use C4 pathways different from the ones that use C3 pathways?
1.  C4 pathway plants tolerate higher temperatures.
2.  C4 plants do photorespiration which is absent in C3 plants.
3.  C4 plants have greater productivity of biomass than C3 plants.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
 Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C4 pathway.
C4 carbon fixation is one of three biochemical processes, along with C3 and CAM photosynthesis, used to fix carbon in plants. It is believed to have evolved more recently.
C4 plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass. So, 1 and 3 are
correct, but 2 is incorrect.

6 In the technique of hydroponics
1.  Soil is used alongwith nutrient solution to grow crops
2.  Crop can be grown without sunlight using artificial lighting.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil. So, 1 is wrong.
Hydroponics requires special "grow lights" to replace sunlight, as most hydroponic gardens are grown inside a building, basement or warehouse. So, 2 is correct.
 Plants that are not traditionally grown in a climate would be possible to grow using a controlled environment system like hydroponics. NASA has also looked to utilize hydroponics in the space program. Ray Wheeler, a plant physiologist from USA, believes that hydroponics will create advances within space travel. He terms this as a bioregenerative life support system.

7 The decision-making in Buddhist sanghas was based on
a)  Consensus arrived at through discussions or voting
b)  Dictation by the senior-most monk within the Sangha
c)  Consent of the enlightened Boddhisatvas
d)  An elaborate hierarchy of monks which passed on decisions from lower to higher levels
Answer: A
 The Buddha's followers came from many social groups including kings as well as workers and slaves. Once within the sangha, all were regarded as equal, having shed their earlier social identities on becoming bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. So, (d) cannot be correct.
Advice of senior-most monks or the Buddha himself was sought on difficult matters. Generally the internal functioning of the sangha was based on the traditions of ganas and sanghas, where consensus was arrived at through discussions.
If that failed, decisions were taken by a vote on the subject. So, (a) is a more appropriate option than (b) or (c).

8 The Economic Survey 2014-15 mentions that banks are in a situation of "Double financial repression". This repression for banks mean
a)  Government regulation of private banks as well as securities markets
b)  Government control of both money and capital markets
c)  Imposition of Basel norms on the banking sector despite structural bottlenecks
d)  Financial repression on both the assets and liabilities side of banks
Answer: D
  Financial repression happens when government borrowing crowds out private sector investment. For e.g. if government borrows too much from the market, too little credit will be available at high interest rates that hurt corporate sector credit deployment and profitability.
Policy problem is exhibited by banks suffering from "Double repression". It means crowding out private sector investments from both asset and liability side.
On the asset side, high SLR requirements and PSL obligations (45% of total lending to agriculture) force less-efficient resource (credit) deployment.
On the liability idea, high inflation since last decade has lead to negative real interest rates, and a sharp reduction in savings.
Therefore, (d) is the most appropriate option.
Option (c) is not a form of financial repression.

b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
 Statement 1 and 2: Matriliny is closely interwoven in Garo and Khasi cultures. In both the societies the jural rights of the women to inherit the land, and other privileges of matriliny raise the status of womenfolk considerably.
The inheritance in both the Khasi and the Garo societies is through the mother and it is restricted to the female line. Thus, in these societies the descent of every
individual is always reckoned and traced through the mother alone.
Statement 3 and 4: The families are patrilineal and patrilocal. The details about these tribe have been covered in previous 
Civil Services (mains) 2015 and Page 55: Chapter 3: 12th NCERT: Themes in

 There were five major political centres in the empire - the capital Pataliputra and the provincial centres of Taxila, Ujjayini, Tosali and Suvarnagiri, all mentioned in Ashokan inscriptions.
These inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day Bangladesh,
India, Nepal, Afghanistan and Pakistan and represent the first tangible evidence of
Buddhism.
The edicts describe in detail the Ashoka's view about dhamma, an earnest attempt to solve some of problems that a complex society faced.

15 The Samanta system in the Gupta Empire refers to
a)  Landlordship of large areas affiliated to farmers
b)  Hierarchical lordship of villages and municipalities in the empire
c)  The system of a closed cabinet that advised the King
d)  Independent rulership of an adjoining territory providing military support to the emperor
Answer: D
 It can refers to a territorial vassal or governor (a person who provides military support and governs a territory) under a king or monarch in exchange for certain guarantees)
The institution of Samanta finds mention for the first time in epigraphs of northern
India dating to the 6th century century.
The institution is considered to belong properly to the Gupta Empire and is closely associated with the origin and growth of feudalism in India.
From the Harshacharitra, we understand that the Samanta had 5 duties. They are: Paying yearly tributes to the emperor.
Paying homage to the emperor in person.
Defeated Samantas had to offer their sons and minor princes to the Emperor so that they are groomed in the imperial traditions and grow to be loyal to the emperor.
Render military aid to the emperor.
Perform administrative and judicial functions in times of peace.

16 Rain water harvesting has which of the following benefits?

18 Consider the following major Political and Economic Developments in ancient India.
1.  Rulers of Magadha consolidate power
2.  Invasion of Alexander of Macedon
3.  Rise of the Chalukyas in Karnataka and of the Pallavas in Tamil Nadu
4.  Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang travels to India in search of Buddhist texts
Which of these is the correct chronological order of the above?
a)  1234
b)  2143
c)  4132
d)  1423
Answer: A
 Rulers of Magadha consolidated power around 500-400 BCE. Alexander invaded around 327-325 BCE. So, 2 must come after 1, which eliminates option (b).
Chalukyas rose around 500-600 CE (much later than Maghadhas), and Xuan Zang visited around 600-650 CE. So, 4 must come after 3. The only answer possible is (a).

19 Consider the following about crop yields in India.
1.  Crop yield of Jowar increases South of Vindhyachal as it becomes an irrigated crop there.
2.  Maize is not grown in southern states but its yield starts increasing towards central
India.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Bajra is sown in southern states as both Kharif and Rabi crops. But it is a kharif crop in northern India where it is mostly grown as a fodder crop. South of Vindhyachal it is a rainfed crop and its yield level is very low in this region. So, 1 is wrong
Statement 2: The leading producers of maize are the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Yield level of maize is higher than other coarse cereals. It is high in southern states and declines towards central parts. So, 2 is correct.

20 The over-use of ground water resources has led to decline in ground water table in some states. It has led to which other problems in some states?
1.  Increased fluoride concentration in ground-water in states like Rajasthan
2.  Increase in concentration of arsenic in parts of West Bengal and Bihar
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Abnormal level of fluoride in water is common in fractured hard rock zone with pegmatite (intrusive igneous rock) veins.
Fluoride ions from these minerals leach into the groundwater and contribute to high fluoride concentrations
The incidence of fluoride above permissible levels of 1.5ppm occur in 14
Indian states, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka,
Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil
Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. So, 1 is correct.
Arsenic contamination of groundwater is a form of groundwater pollution which is often due to naturally occurring high concentrations of arsenic in deeper levels of groundwater.
High levels of arsenic above the permissible levels of 50 parts per billion
(ppb) are found in the alluvial plains of Ganges.
Presence of heavy metals in groundwater is found in 13 states, viz., Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and five blocks of Delhi.
So, 2 is also correct.

21 Urban smog or photochemical smog found in cities like Delhi is formed due to
a)  Chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere
b)  Reaction of volatile organic compounds with lead and nitrogen in the atmosphere
c)  Reaction of sunlight with nitrogen and sulphur dioxides in the atmosphere
d)  Chemical reaction of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere
Answer: A
 Photochemical smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles and ground-level ozone. This noxious mixture of air pollutants may include the following:
Aldehydes
Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide
Peroxyacyl nitrates
Tropospheric ozone
Volatile organic compounds
All of these harsh chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization.
It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles like in Delhi.

Answer: D
 The Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests, a tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests ecoregion, encompasses the plateau.
The plateau is covered with a variety of different habitats of which Sal forest is predominant. So, 1 is correct.
The plateau is also swampy in some places and in other parts is covered with bamboo grasslands and shrubs. So, 2 is correct.
Tigers, Asian elephants, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, chinkara, dhole wild dog and sloth bear are some of the animals found here while birds include the threatened lesser florican, Indian grey hornbill and other hornbills. So, 3 is correct.

23 Which type of areas can be classified as wastelands?
1.  Steep sloping land
2.  Coastal sands
3.  Land with weed growth
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Statement 1: Steep sloping land can be declared unfit for any agricultural activity. Crops like tea or coffee are grown on mild slopes. Even if you are in doubt about statement 1, you should look at other statements and options to finalize your answer.
Statement 2: Coastal sands are unfit for growing crops and thus classified as a wasteland. So, 2 is correct.
Statement 3: High weed growth shows that the land is still productive but not maintained. It can be used for agricultural activities if maintained well. So, 3 will be incorrect.
So, if 2 is correct and 3 is incorrect, the only appropriate option will be (a).

24 Consider the following statements about India's foreign trade.
1.  More of India's foreign trade is carried through the sea routes than land routes.
2.  More of India's foreign trade is carried with South Asian neighbours than the rest of the world.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Statement 1: Most of India's foreign trade is carried through sea and
air routes. However, a small portion is also carried through land route to neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: India's global trade was worth an estimated $800 billion in 2012-13, of which only about $17 billion was with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) partners. SAARC includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.

25 Formation of coastal lagoons is facilitated by
1.  Presence of indented coastline
2.  Gently sloping coasts
3.  High range of tides
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Coastal lagoons form along gently sloping coasts where barrier islands or reefs can develop off-shore, and the sea-level is rising relative to the land along the shore. So, 1 is correct.
India has a vast coastline and the coast is very indented in some states. Due to this, a number of lagoons and lakes have formed. So, 2 is also correct.
Coastal lagoons do not form along steep or rocky coasts, or if the range of tides is more than 4 metres. Due to the gentle slope of the coast, coastal lagoons are shallow.
A relative drop in sea level may leave a lagoon largely dry, while a rise in sea level may let the sea breach or destroy barrier islands, and leave reefs too
deep under water to protect the lagoon. So, 3 is incorrect.

26 Consider the following domestic freight transport modes.
1.  Roadways
2.  Railways
3.  Inland waterways
Arrange the above in order of decreasing share in domestic freight traffic?
a)  123
b)  213
c)  231
d)  132
Answer: A
Statement 1 and 2: Railways accounted for about 42% and roadways for about 58% of India's total freight traffic in 2011-12. This is partly linked to an increase in the share of manufactured goods like white goods, fast moving consumer (FMC) goods etc. These cargos move over shorter distances and are time sensitive. So, 1>2, and options (b) and (c) are eliminated.
Statement 3: Inland waterways in India makes up a paltry 3% of the total transport, compared with China's 47%; in the European Union it stands at 44%.

27 How the development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in the colonial period?
1.  Very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain.
2.  Englishmade cotton textiles ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in
Africa, America and Europe.
3.  An export promotion obligation was imposed on domestic cotton textiles in India which increased imports at the expense of exports.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
After the development of British textile industries, Indian textiles had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. British slowly displaced traditional Indian markets. So, 2 is correct.
Exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. So, 1 is correct.
No such export promotion obligations were put. They would have actually hurt
British interests. So, 3 is incorrect.
By the beginning of the nineteenth century, thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit.
English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out loans and advances.

28 The State/Union territory (UT) with the highest road density in India is
a)  Tripura
b)  Goa
c)  Kerala
d)  Delhi
Answer: D
 Kerala with a road network of 5,268.69 km per 1,000 sq km surpasses all other states while Tripura with a road density of 3,026.23 km per
1,000 sq km ranks second, as per figures of the year 2008 in economic survey
2011-12.
Goa has the fourth highest road density in the country among states with a road network stretching 2,854.94 km per 1,000 sq km of area.
But the union territories have even better road density than bigger states. Delhi ranks first among the states and union territories with a density of
19,931.89 km per 1,000 sq km while Chandigarh is a close second with
18,578.95 km per 1,000 sq km. Puducherry and Lakshadweep have road density of more than 5,000 km per 1,000 sq kms.

d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: C
 Statement 1: The services of both INSAT and IRS are being taken by the IMD for meterological purposes.
Statement 2: INSAT helps provides location information of the distress signals transmitted by beacons mounted on board ships, aircraft or those carried by individuals.
The location information is determined instantaneously and informed to rescue coordination centres for carrying out search and rescue operations of the affected ship, aircraft or individuals. So, 2 is correct.
Statement 3: It is as well-known fact that transponders carried on the satellites of INSAT enable telecommunication and broadcasting.
Statement 4: It is done by Indian remote Sensing (IRS) satellites.

30 The Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub Plan is primarily intended to
a)  Family-oriented income-generation schemes in sectors of agriculture and allied activities
b)  Develop tribal markets for better promotion of indigenous tribal arts and culture
c)  Provide independent grants to Gram Sabhas only for creation of critical infrastructure
d)  Open primary schools in remote tribal hamlets
Answer: A
The Special Central Assistance (SCa) is provided by the Ministry of tribal Affairs to the State Government as an additive to the State TSP.
SCA is primarily meant for family-oriented income-generation schemes in sectors of agriculture, horticulture sericulture and animal husbandry cooperation.
A part of SCA (not more than 30%) is also permitted to be used for development of infrastructure incidental to such income generating schemes. So, (c) is incorrect.
Tribal populace Below Poverty Line should alone be supported with
SCA financed activities.

31 Petroleum refineries are preferably located near to the markets and not the oil fields, why?
1.  The industry uses a non-weight-losing raw material.
2.  Several products derived from crude oil can be used as raw material in other industries.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Concept:In weight-losing industries, the weight of the final product is less than the weight of the raw material going into making the product. For example, in the copper industry, it would be very expensive to
haul raw materials to the market for processing.
So, industries using weight-losing raw materials are located in the regions where raw materials are located.
Since Crude oil is not a weight losing raw material, industries should ideally be located close to the market then. 1 will be correct.
Transport of crude oil is easier and several products derived from them are used as raw material in other industries nearby in the market. Koyali, Mathura and Barauni refineries are typical examples. 2 will be correct.

32 Bulk of the valuable minerals in India are
1.  Products of Hadean age
2.  Mainly associated with Sedimentary rocks
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Bulk of the valuable minerals in India are products of pre-Palaeozoic age spanning from 541 to 252.17 million years ago. Hadean age refers to the one right after formation of earth. So, 1 is incorrect.
These minerals are mostly associated with metamorphic and igneous rocks of the peninsular India, and not sedimentary rocks. So, 2 is incorrect too.
The vast alluvial plain tract of north India is devoid of minerals of economic use.

33 The Northern Black Polished Ware culture (NBPW) is an urban culture belonging to the
a)  Iron Age
b)  Copper Age
c)  Bronze Age
d)  Gold Age
Answer: A
 It is an urban Iron Age culture of the Indian Subcontinent, lasting
c) 700-200 BCE, succeeding the Painted Grey Ware culture and Black and red ware culture.
It developed beginning around 700 BC, or in the late Vedic period, and peaked from
c) 500-300 BC, coinciding with the emergence of 16
great states or mahajanapadas in Northern India, and the subsequent rise of the Mauryan Empire.
After recent excavations at Gotihwa in Nepal, archaeologist Giovanni
Verardi by radiocarbon datings says that proto-NBPW is at least from
900 BC.

34 Maitri and Dakshin Gangotri are
a)  Indian research stations in Antarctica
b)  Observatories placed by IOR-ARC in the South China Sea
c)  Ice tracking mechanism in the Arctic
d)  Indian defence bases in the proposed MAUSAM project
Answer: A
The Indian Antarctic Program is a multi-disciplinary, multi- institutional program under the control of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India.
It was initiated in 1981 with the first Indian expedition to Antarctica.
The program gained global acceptance with India's signing of the Antarctic Treaty and subsequent construction of the Dakshin Gangotri Antarctic research base in 1983, superseded by the Maitri base from
1990.
Under the program, atmospheric, biological, earth, chemical, and medical sciences are studied by India, which has carried out several scientific expeditions to the Antarctic.

37 Patidevakas in the ancient times were
a)  Officers who reported the activities in the country to the government
b)  Male village headmen who also supervised local village court functioning
c)  Male performers in the royal courts
d)  Owner of large land deeds given as a gift by the government
Answer: A
The duty of these officers was to superintend or oversee all that occurred in town or country and to make private reports to the
government.
Arian notes that similar officers were employed by the authorities of the independent nations as well as by the monarchical governments of India.
King Devanampiya says, "the patidevakas should report to me about the affairs of the people at all times, anywhere, whether I am eating, in the inner apartment, in the bedroom or in the garden. And I will dispose of the affairs of the people everywhere."

38 Tides can be helpful in
1.  Removing polluted water from river estuaries
2.  Generating electric power
3.  Deep Sea mineral explorations
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
Statement 1: Because most estuaries are influenced by lunar tides, the once-daily (diurnal) or twice-daily (semidiurnal) rise and fall of water results in a net flow out of the estuary. This helps clean the estuary. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: Tidal power plants harness the rise and fall of water to store water and release it for generating hydel power. A 3 MW tidal power project at Durgaduani in Sunderbans of West Bengal is under way. So, 2 is correct.

39 Why the groundwater potential in the Northern, Western and Peninsular
regions of India is lesser as compared to valleys and other lower lying areas?
1.  The mountainous and hilly regions in the north and west do not allow adequate infiltration of groundwater.
2.  The underlying geology limits the formation of large continuous aquifers in the peninsular part of the country.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 The presence and availability of groundwater varies greatly with changes in topography, subsurface geology and the prevailing climate in the region. In some areas, groundwater exists in deep aquifers while in others the water is stored near the surface. The location of the aquifer also affects its recharge rate and its susceptibility to pollution and overuse.
Statement 1: In general, the mountainous and hilly regions in the north and west do not allow adequate infiltration and thus formation of aquifers is very limited and potential is less. As a consequence, groundwater is mostly limited to valleys and other lower lying areas. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: Almost the entire peninsular region is covered by a variety of hard rock and fissure formations. So, the aquifers are discontinuous and as a result the yield is very limited.
If the rock formation is porous, formation of large aquifers is possible and yield will be high.

40 Which of the following ports are major ports managed by the Central government?
1.  Tuticorin
2.  Kandla
3.  Paradwip
4.  Trombay
5.  Port Blair
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 3 and 5 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
Answer: C
 Kandla Port is located on the Gulf of Kutch. It is the largest port of India by volume of cargo handled - nearly 87 million tonnes annually. Second largest is Visakhapatnam.
Paradip Port is an artificial and deep-water port. Tuticorin Port is an artificial deep-sea harbour of India. Trombay and Port blair are minor ports managed by the state
government. So, 4 and 5 are incorrect.

41 Surface salinity of ocean water in Polar Regions is most influenced by
a)  Freezing and thawing of ice
b)  Heavy precipitation
c)  Fresh water flow from rivers
d)  Biomass upwelling from the ocean bed
Answer: A
The thawing of large icebergs (made of frozen fresh water and lacking any salt) will decrease the salinity while the actual freezing of seawater will increase the salinity temporarily. So, (a) is correct.
Heavy precipitation occurs in tropical areas affecting ocean water
salinity. Same is true for fresh water flow from rivers. Effect is minimal in Polar Regions. So, (b) and (c) are not as appropriate as (a).

42 Apart from compounds like carbon dioxide, which of the following are involved in air pollution?
1.  Beryllium
2.  Ammonia
3.  Asbestos
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Statement 1: Inhalation exposure to beryllium primarily occurs in the workplaces where it is mined, processed, or converted into alloys and chemicals, or from the burning of coal or fuel oil and in tobacco smoke. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to high levels
of beryllium has been observed to cause inflammation of the lungs.
Statement 2: Both gaseous and particulate ammonia contribute to eutrophication of surface waters, soil acidification, fertilization of vegetation, changes in ecosystems and smog and decreased visibility in cities and pristine areas.
Statement 3: Instead of forming dust particles when crushed, asbestos divides into millions of fine fibers in the manufacturing process. Asbestos fibers can have serious effects on human health if inhaled.

43 Consider the following about Agrahara of the ancient period.
1.  It was land granted to a Brahmana who was usually exempted from paying land revenue.
2.  The land holder could collect land dues from the local people.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
An agrahara was land granted to a Brahmana, who was usually exempted from paying land revenue and other dues to the king, and was often given the right to collect these dues from the local people. So, both 1 and 2 are correct.
Agraharams were also known as Chaturvedimangalams in ancient times. They were also known as ghatoka, and boya.
In the medieval period Agraharas became the foremost educational institutions in southern India during the medieval period.
They were group settlements of brahmins who formed a corporate body and administered all affairs of the agrahara, including education.

44 Share of land use in India is highest in which of these categories?
a)  Forests
b)  Area under non-agricultural use
c)  Permanent Pastures
d)  Net Sown Area
Answer: D
The figure below (or in the Q source) mentions land use percentages. The data is old, but the broad patterns are likely to be the
same.
Land use pattern qt any given time is determined by several factors including size of human and livestock population, the demand pattern, the technology in use, the cultural traditions, the location and capability of land, institutional factors like ownership pattern and rights and state regulation.
Agricultural land in India totals a little over 50 percent of the total geographical area in the country. This is the highest among the large and medium-sized countries of the world.

45 The distinction between Kharif, Rabi and Zaid seasons is not as marked in South India as it in Northern India, and tropical crops can be grown during any period in the year in Southern India. This is due to
a)  Appropriate year-round temperature for crop growth in Southern India
b)  Soil in southern India is more nutrient rich than any part of Northern India
c)  High incidence of inter-cropping in South India as compared to Northern India
d)  All of (a), (b) and (c)
Answer: A
In Southern India, the temperature is high enough to grow tropical crops during any period in the year provided the soil
moisture is available.
Therefore, in this region same crops can be grown thrice in an agricultural year provided there is sufficient soil moisture. So, (a) is correct.
Even if intercropping is followed and there is insufficient temperature, crops cannot be grown. So, (c) is incorrect.
Option (b) is wrong.

46 Consider the following about the Permanent Settlement of 1793.
1.  The British recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars.
2.  The zamindars collected rent from the peasants to pay revenue to the
East India Company.
3.  The revenue amount to be paid was fixed only for a financial year and then revised accordingly.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
Statement 3: The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future.
It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company's coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land.
Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land.

47 Which of the following can give some evidence of the social differences existing in the Harappan period?
1.  Studying burial grounds
2.  Studying artefacts
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: Differences could be found in the way the burial pit were made. For e.g. in some instances, the hollowed-out spaces were lined with bricks. Some graves contained pottery and ornaments. These can indicate differences in social status. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: Another strategy to identify social differences is to study artefacts, which archaeologists broadly classify as utilitarian and luxuries.
If we study the distribution of such artefacts, we find that rare objects made of valuable materials are generally concentrated in large settlements like Mohenjodaro and Harappa and are rarely found in the smaller settlements.
For example, miniature pots of faience, perhaps used as
perfume bottles, are found mostly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa, and there are none from small settlements like Kalibangan.
Gold too was rare. These too indicate differences in social status. So, 2 is also correct.

48 As per the philosophy of Ramanuja
a)  All the objects in creation are illusory
b)  God, soul and matter are real
c)  Only the privileged ones can attain salvation
d)  God is without attributes and far from human grasp
Answer: B
Ramanuja preached Visishtadvaita in the twelfth century.
According to him God is Sagunabrahman (with attributes).
The creative process and all the objects in creation are real but not illusory as was held by Sankaracharya.
Therefore, God, soul, matter are real. But God is inner substance and the rest are his attributes.
He also advocated prabattimarga or path of self-surrender to
God.
He invited the downtrodden to Vaishnavism.

49 Indian cities are classified as metropolitan or non-metropolitan based on which criterion?
a)  Geographical extent
b)  Level of manufacturing activity
c)  Population size
d)  Per capita income
Answer: C
The Classification of Indian cities comprises a ranking system used by the Government of India to allocate House Rent Allowance (HRa) to public servants employed in different cities in the country.
HRA is also used by the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) to provide income tax exemptions. Cities are classified on HRA and on the basis of their population, as recommended by the Sixth Central Pay Commission in 2008 and Reserve Bank of India respectively
A Metropolitan area has a population of ten lakhs (one million) or more, and comprises one or more districts comprising two or more Municipalities or Panchayats or other contiguous area, specified by the Governor by public notification. So, (c) is correct.

50 Restricted Service (RS) and Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided under Indian Regional Navigation Satellite system (IRNSS) differ with respect to?
a)  Geographical area coverage
b)  User base and authorization
c)  Extension to ocean routes
d)  Timing of service
Answer: B
RS is an encrypted service provided to authorised users such as military.
Standard Positioning Service (SPS) is made available to all users. So, most appropriate option would be (b).
IRNSS consists of constellation of seven satellites of which three are geostationary and four are non-geostationary.
This satellite system aims to provide real-time data on the position of objects to aid road, air and maritime traffic. It will also provide mapping and tracking services.

51 Which of the following arguments cannot be given by the tradition of the
Ajivikas?
a)  All events are entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles.
b)  There is an atman in every living being.
c)  Good deeds only will lead to salvation.
d)  Human beings do not have free will.
Answer: C
Even if you haven't read Ajivika sect philosophy, you can logically eliminate options and reach the right answer.
Suppose if (a) is correct, then (d) follows, because if everything is predestined based on universal principles, human beings cannot have free will.
Also, if everything is predetermined, salvation or moksha cannot depend on your deeds. It must be predestined too, which is the point made in (c). You get salvation when universal principles align in a particular way, and not just by your good or bad deeds.
So, the only answer here can be (c). We did not even need to eliminate option (b).
 It was founded in the 5th century BCE by Makkhali
Gosala.
It is known for its Niyati doctrine of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles.
It considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Followers of the sect were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an
?tman-a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.

52 The Deccan trap was formed due to
a)  Volcanic action
b)  Filling of Geosynclinal depression
c)  Deposition of river sediments
d)  Filling of ocean depression
Answer: A
 One of the distinct features of the peninsular plateau is the
black soil area known as Decean Trap.
This is of volcanic origin hence the rocks are igneous. Actually these rocks have denuded over time and are responsible for the formation of black soil.
The release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary climate change.

53 Consider the following statements about a river.
1.  Recently the Union Government has signed a Financing Agreement with World Bank for the river basin development.
2.  The river is known as sorrow of Bihar.
The above refer to?
a)  Gandak
b)  Kosi
c)  Nirmala
d)  Damodar
Answer: B
The WB loan Project objective is to enhance:
Resilience to floods from Kosi River which is infamously dubbed as sorrow of Bihar and increase agricultural production and productivity of targeted districts along the river basin. State's capacity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency.
Five components of Project are:
Improving Flood Risk Management. Augmenting Connectivity.
Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness. Implementation Support
Contingent Emergency Response.
The primary beneficiaries of this Project are rural households and
producers in the Kosi River Basin who are regularly exposed to floods.
It will mainly include farmers who have lost their agricultural lands by the devastating 2008 Kosi River Flood due to the silt deposition.

54 The Union Cabinet has recently given its approval to Policy on Promotion of City Compost. How will this policy help in circulating compost produced from city waste for the purpose of farming and agriculture?
1.  Farmers will be benefitted from lower MRP of city compost as result of Market development assistance.
2.  All registered fertilizer companies will receive free city compost for conversion to fertilizer to exclusively supply agricultural farms.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Composting is process of recycling of organic matter or waste into useful fertilizers for soil. Compost obtained from city garbage will provide primary as well as secondary nutrients to soil improving its productivity.
Statement 1: For increasing production and consumption of City Compost, provision for Market development assistance of Rs. 1500 per tonne of city compost has been added. This assistance will reduce MRP for farmers. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: It is wrong. Instead, fertilizer companies will co-market City Compost along with chemical fertilizers. For promoting the use of compost, these companies will adopt villages.

55 Which one of the following States/Union Territories (UTs) of India has the highest rank in the Human Development Index after Kerala?
a)  Goa
b)  Maharashtra
c)  TamilNadu
d)  Delhi
Answer: D
These are old figures, but the trend is likely to be the same. Kerala has the highest HDI at about 0.790, Delhi has around 0.750, and next is Himachal Pradesh at 0.652. Rest all states and UTs other than Goa and Punjab, have HDI lesser than 0.6.
So, Kerala and Delhi qualify as high HDI states, and others as either medium HDI or low HDI states.

56 Sikkim has formally become India's first fully organic state as it has
a)  Banned the production of meat in the state
b)  Increased the forest cover to the stipulated legal requirement
c)  Allowed business expansion in the state by way of new product development as opposed to mergers and acquisitions
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Sikkim has successfully implemented organic farming practices on around 75,000 hectares of agricultural land.
Formal declaration in this regard was made by the Prime
Minister.
The state government had banned entry and sale of chemical inputs for farmland in phases and also moved away from subsidies to farmers for purchasing chemical inputs.
It forced farmers in state to organic cultivation.
Since then agricultural land in state was gradually converted to
certified organic land by using organic practices. For this state had implemented principles ad guidelines prescribed in National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP).

c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The Head of the State is the Governor. She/He is appointed by the Central Government to ensure that the State Government works within the rules and regulations of the Constitution. So, 1 is correct.
If it is not so, s/he can submit a report to the Central government which can then consider taking action against the State government including President's rule.
The chairman of the Legislative assembly is elected by the assembly itself. So, 2 is incorrect.

59 Within the district administration land disputes can be heard at the office of
a)  Patwari
b)  Tehsildar
c)  Village Land Committee
d)  Village Ward Councillors
Answer: B
 At the head is the District Collector and under her are the revenue officers, also known as tehsildars.
They have to hear disputes. They also supervise the work of the Patwaris and ensure that records are properly kept and land revenue is collected.
They make sure that the farmers can easily obtain a copy of their record, students can obtain their caste certificates etc.
The Tehsildar's office is where land disputes are also heard.

60 Shahmina refers to
a)  A type of shawl made from Pashmina wool
b)  A fabric made of both cotton and silk in the Deccan region of India
c)  A type of bark cloth made from hardwood trees found in Jammu and Kashmir
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
 Shahmina shawls are hand spun, woven on only handlooms and embroidered by hand in Kashmir, and made from fine cashmere fibre which is textured and processed exactly as Shahtoosh.
It is made without artificial chemicals.
The purest shahmina, which is made on handlooms, does not have a consistent weave and may have flaws which are characteristic of the fabric.

61 Consider the following statements.
1.  It is known as Kakanaya and Bota-Sriparvata in ancient times.
2.  It has the singular distinction of having specimen of Buddhist art and
architecture from the early Mauryan period.
3.  It is a world heritage site.
The above refer to?
a)  Ajanta Caves
b)  Bodh-Gaya
c)  Elephanta Caves
d)  Sanchi
Answer: D
The Great Stupa at Sanchi is the oldest stone structure in India and was originally commissioned by the emperor Ashoka in 3rd Century BCE.
He erected the Great Stupa here after redistribution of mortal remains of Lord Buddha for erecting several stupas all over the country in
order to spread Buddhism. This stupa was originally a low structure of brick.
It is also known as Kakanava and Kakanadabota.
Since the fourteenth century Sanchi remained deserted and uncared for till 1818 when General Taylor rediscovered the site. Sir John Marshall established an archaeological museum in 1919, which was later transformed into the present site museum at Sanchi.

62 Why do we get muscle cramps after heavy exercise?
a)  Anaerobic respiration of muscle cells
b)  Improvement in the blood flow in the body
c)  Drying of joint movement fluids
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
Synovial fluid is the slippery fluid that fills most of the body's joints. If it dries up it can cause a pain/fracture in joints. It is not
the reason for the cramps. So, (c) is not correct.
The cramps occur when muscle cells respire anaerobically. The partial breakdown of glucose produces lactic acid. The accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle cramps.
We get relief from cramps after a hot water bath or a massage.
Hot water bath or massage improves circulation of blood.
As a result, the supply of oxygen to the muscle cells increases. The increase in the supply of oxygen results in the complete breakdown of lactic acid into carbon dioxide and water.

64 Which river basin has the highest total replenishable ground water resource?
a) Ganga
b) Pennar
c)  Kaveri
d)  Brahmaputra
Answer: A
 Brahmaputra has nearly 27 cubic km per year, Ganga has 171, Kaveri nearly 12, and the Pennar has the least at nearly 4. So, (a) is the answer
 Groundwater levels across India are falling and the quality of ground water is also declining. The decline is particularly sharp around Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan.
Construction around the Aravalli hills has severely disturbed the ground water recharge in the entire region.

65 By the first century CE, there is evidence of changes in Buddhist ideas and practices. Under the new Mahanaya tradition, Bodhisattas were perceived as
a)  the ones who wish for the salvation of others before attaining final nirvana
b)  the ones who transcended the world of senses
c)  those who have just begun their spiritual journey
d)  the ordained worshippers of Buddhist idols and sculptures
Answer: A
The term Boddhisatvas have been subject to multiple interpretations.
In early Indian Buddhism, the term bodhisattva was primarily used to refer specifically to Gautama Buddha in his former life. From this Jataka tales, Bodhisattva originally meant the Buddhism practitioner of austerities.
In later Theravada literature, the term "bodhisatta" is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to liberation. According to some Mah?y?na sources a bodhisattva is someone on the path to full Buddhahood. Others speak of bodhisattvas renouncing Buddhahood.
However, under the new tradition most accepted definition is the one who aspires to become buddha as soon as possible and then help sentient beings in full fledge.

66 The continental shelves become the source of fossil fuels due to
a)  Sediments brought down by rivers
b)  Sea-floor spreading
c)  Formation of coral reefs at bay
d)  Movement of fossil fuel from ocean bed to the shelves
Answer: A
 A continental shelf is the edge of a continent that lies under the ocean.
A continental shelf extends from the coastline of a continent to a drop- off point called the shelf break. From the break, the shelf descends toward the deep ocean floor in what is called the continental slope.
Even though they are underwater, continental shelves are part of the continent. So, (d) cannot be correct.
Sea-floor spreading occurs at mid-oceanic ridges far from the shelves, as also covered in the previous 
The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, wind, from the land and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves, become the source of fossil fuels. So, (a) is correct.

68 The terms-Build Operate Transfer (BOT) and Engineering Procurement
Model (EPC)-are related to
a)  Public Private Partnership (PPP) models usually in infrastructure
b)  Delegation of responsibilities within government departments concerning mineral exploration projects
c)  New techniques of eco-friendly construction
d)  Models for construction in seismically sensitive zones
Answer: A
 BOT is a type of arrangement in which the private sector builds an infrastructure project, operates it and eventually transfers ownership of the project to the government. In many instances, the government becomes the firm's only customer and promises to purchase at least a predetermined amount of the project's output. This ensures that the firm recoups its initial investment in a reasonable time span.
This type of arrangement is used typically in complicated long- term projects as seen in power plants and water treatment facilities.
In some arrangements, the government does not assume ownership of the project. In those cases, the company continues running the facility and the government acts as both the consumer and regulator.
EPC- The engineering and construction contractor will carry out the detailed engineering design of the project, procure all the equipment and materials necessary, and then construct to deliver a functioning facility or asset to their clients.

2.  Increasing the fallow duration of land leading to sparse cropping
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Leguminous crops help fix nitrogen in the soil. If they are displaced, then the process of nitrogen fixation would reduce or slow down to totally end depending on the nutrient availability in the soil. So, 1 is correct.
If the duration of fallow is substantially reduced owing to multiple cropping, the soil does not get enough time to recuperate and allow natural fertilization like nitrogen fixation. If fallow is increased, it will help in nutrient replenishment. So, 2 is incorrect.

74 According to Jaina teachings, the cycle of birth and rebirth is shaped through
a)  Karma
b)  Soul's expression
c)  Unfolding of human consciousness
d)  Destiny of the Universe
Answer: A
  Human moral actions form the basis of the transmigration of the soul.
Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma.
The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution.
The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.
Asceticism and penance are required to free oneself from the cycle of karma. This can be achieved only by renouncing the world; therefore, monastic existence is a necessary condition of salvation.

a)  Halo effect of the meteoroids
b)  Friction with the air causing heating and burning
c)  Interaction of meteoroids with the debris in stratosphere
d)  Reflection of light from the Sun falling on the meteoroids
Answer: B
Most meteoroids burn up when they enter the atmosphere. The left-over debris is called meteoric dust or just meteor dust.
Meteor dust particles can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months. These particles might affect climate, both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere.
Meteoroids that blaze a trail through the atmosphere are called meteors, or shooting stars. Only those that make it to the ground are meteorites.

b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Lord Dalhousie started the final wave of annexation as the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse.
The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would "lapse", that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854).
Finally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh citing "obligation" and "duty" to protect Awadh people from exploitation. This finally lead to the 1857 revolt.

85 Ashtadhyayi is the
a)  Compilation of astronomical interpretations by ancient seers
b)  First known description of a binary numeral system
c)  Summary and synthesis of the philosophical and spiritual ideas in the Upanishads
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 It is a sanskrit treatise on grammar written in the 6th to 5th century BCE by Panini. This work set the linguistic standards for Classical Sanskrit.
Beyond defining the morphology and syntax of Sanskrit language, Ashtadhyayi distinguishes between usage in the spoken language and usage that is proper to the language of the sacred texts.
It is the earliest known work on linguistic description, and together with the work of his immediate predecessors (the Niruktas, Nighantus, and Pratishakyas) stands at the beginning of the history of linguistics itself. His theory of morphological analysis was more advanced than any equivalent Western theory before the mid 20th century.

the then Governor-General of India
He recommended therein that:
An education department was to be set up in every province. Universities on the model of the London university be established in big cities such as Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. At least one government school be opened in every district. So, (c) can't be the answer.
Affiliated private schools should be given grant in aid.
The Indian natives should be given training in their mother tongue also.
Provision was made for a systematic method of education from primary level to the university level.
The government should always support education for women. So, (a) can't be the answer.
It emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. So, (b) can't be the answer.
European learning, it said, would introduce them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe.

88 An atoll is a
a)  ring-shaped coral reef island
b)  A low island near a lagoon
c)  An island of tectonic origin
d)  An island formed due to deposition of sediments on the ocean
floor
Answer: A
An atoll surrounds a body of water called a lagoon. Sometimes, atolls and lagoons protect a central island. Channels between islets connect a lagoon to the Open Ocean or sea.
Atolls develop with underwater volcanoes, called seamounts. First, the volcano erupts, piling up lava on the seafloor.
As the volcano continues to erupt, the seamount's elevation grows higher, eventually breaking the surface of the water. The top of the volcano becomes an oceanic island.

89 Rainwater analysis of urban environment has indicated that pH value of
the first rain after summer is always lower than the subsequent rains. This can be related to the phenomenon of
a)  Acid rain
b)  Inversion effect
c)  Presence of terpenes in the atmosphere
d)  Ambient atmospheric temperature after the first showers
Answer: A
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acidic pollution from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface.
The acidic pollution can be formed due to oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which will be in larger amounts suspended in the atmosphere, and get washed away in large amounts after the first rain. In later
spells of rain, lower and lower quantity may be present which is washed away as acid rain. So, (a) will be correct.
Terpenes are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers. They are not relevant here. So, (c) is incorrect.

95 Which of these sectors is the highest user of surface as well as groundwater in India?
a)  Households
b)  Industry
c)  Agriculture
d)  Energy sector
Answer: C
As much as 55% of India's total water supply comes from groundwater resources. Irrigation accounts for nearly 90% of total groundwater water used. Its share is much higher in agriculture-heavy states.
Surface water is the major source of water for the industries (41%) followed by groundwater (35%) and municipal water (24%).
The use of municipal water is limited to industries located in urban/ peri-urban areas.
Sectors like pharmaceuticals, power, food processing and agriculture feel the brunt of poor water quality.
High costs for obtaining water are hindering the business interest of smaller industries and the ones which are located in the drier regions of the country.

96 Consider the following about the trends in Union Government's fiscal deficit.

The revenue deficit of the Union stood at 4.3 per cent of GDP in
2001-02 and was brought down to 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2004-05 and
1.1 per cent of GDP in 2007-08. It then rose to 5.2 per cent in 2009-10 because of a substantial increase in revenue expenditures on subsidies, interest payments and salaries and pensions. So, 2 is also incorrect.
