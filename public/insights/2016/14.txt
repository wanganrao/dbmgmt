2 The Amending Act (1781) to the Regulating Act of 1773 had which of the following provisions?
1.  Increase in the jurisdiction of Supreme Court established by the Regulating Act
1773
2.  Recognition of the appellate jurisdiction of the Governor-General-in-Council
3.  Enactment of a temporary Uniform Civil Code
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: D
Statement 1: It was actually the opposite. The act significantly reduced the powers of the Supreme Court at Calcutta. The actions of the servants of the Company in their official capacity were exempted from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
It also separated the Governor-General-in-Council and revenue matters from the
Court's jurisdiction.
Statement 2: The Act recognized the appellate jurisdiction of the Governor-General- in-Council.
It empowered the Governor-General and Council to convene as a Court of Record to hear appeals from the Provincial Courts on civil cases. It meant that appeal could be taken from the provincial courts to the Governor General & Council and that was to be the final court of appeal.
Statement 3: The Act asserted that Mohammedan cases should be determined by
Mohammedan law and Hindu law applied in Hindu cases. So, 3 is clearly wrong.

3 The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank has launched its first Uridashi Masala Bonds. Why corporate prefer Masala Bonds over External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs)?
a)  Masala bonds do not face currency fluctuation risks.
b)  There is no limit to borrowing under Masala bonds unlike ECBs.
c)  Masala Bonds are subsidized by the government.
d)  Masala bonds are not bought and sold under market mechanism unlike ECBs.
Answer: A
Option (b) can be easily eliminated as India has quantitative restrictions over capital account (like foreign currency borrowing and lending).
Option (c) is wrong. Option (d) is also wrong, as Masala bonds are also market related instruments issued by the IFC.
Option (a): They are issued to foreign investors and settled in US dollars. Hence the
currency risk lies with the investor and not the issuer, unlike external commercial borrowings (ECBs), where Indian companies raise money in foreign currency loans. While ECBs help companies take advantage of the lower interest rates in international markets, the cost of hedging the currency risk can be significant.

4 Which of the following phenomenon is observed due to Doppler Effect?
1.  Increase in sound of Car Siren when it is approaching
2.  Redshift
3.  Neutron bombing in Nuclear Reactors
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: A
The Doppler Effect (or Doppler shift) is the change in frequency of a wave (or other periodic event) for an observer moving relative to its source.
For e.g. it causes a car engine or siren to sound higher in pitch when it is approaching than when it is receding.
The Doppler Effect for electromagnetic waves such as light is of great use in astronomy and results in either a so-called redshift or blueshift. It has been used to measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us; that is, their radial velocities.

5 Consider the following statements about the Act of 1909 which is also known as Morley- Minto Reforms.
1.  It introduced a system of communal representation.
2.  It provided for the association of Indians with the executive Councils of the Viceroy and Governors.
3.  It curtailed the deliberative functions of the legislative councils at the provincial level but increased the same at Central level.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
Statement 1: It introduced a system of communal representation for Muslims by accepting the concept of 'separate electorate'. Under this, the Muslim members were to be elected only by Muslim voters. Thus, the Act 'legalised communalism' and Lord Minto came to be known as the Father of Communal Electorate.
Statement 2: Satyendra Prasad Sinha became the first Indian to join the Viceroy's
Executive Council. He was appointed as the law member.
Statement 3: It enlarged the deliberative functions of the legislative councils at both the levels. For example, members were allowed to ask supplementary questions, move resolutions on the budget, and so on.
Statement 4: This was done in the Act of 1919.

6 The protected area which hosts Mangroves as well as the Giant Salt Water Crocodiles is
a)  Hemis National Park

Answer: B
Mangroves, saltwater crocodile, white crocodile, Indian python, black ibis, wild pigs, rhesus monkeys, chital are the major attractions in the Bhitarkanika park.
Both Hemis and Khirganga are in Himachal Pradesh and thus cannot host mangroves and salt water crocodile. Option (a) can be eliminated.
Papikonda does not host mangroves. So, (d) is also eliminated.

7 A geostationary orbit is a particular type of geosynchronous orbit where a satellite in geosynchronous orbit returns to the same point in the sky at the same time each day. This is made possible as
1.  The satellite orbits directly above the poles.
2.  The satellite follows the direction of the Earth's rotation.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
It is a circular orbit nearly 36,000 kilometres above the Earth's equator following the direction of the Earth's rotation.
An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day), and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers.
Communications satellites and weather satellites are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas (located on earth) which communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located

8 The raga which is sung late in night is
a)  Raga Darbari
b)  Raga Todi

9 Which of the following statements is INCORRECT with regard to Polar Vortex?
a)  It is a large-scale cyclone.
b)  Coriolis force is needed for a Polar vortex to be sustained.
c)  It strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer.
d)  It reduces depletion of ozone.
Answer: D
Option (a): There are two polar vortices in the atmosphere of planet Earth, one around the North Pole, and one around the South Pole. Each polar vortex is a persistent, large-scale cyclone, circling the planet's geographical poles.
The bases of the two polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and extend into the stratosphere.
Option (b): As with other cyclones, their rotation is caused by the Coriolis effect. Option (c): These cold-core low-pressure areas strengthen in the winter and weaken
in the summer due to their dependence upon the temperature differential between
the equator and the poles.
When the polar vortex is strong, the Westerlies increase in strength. When the polar cyclone is weak, the general flow pattern across mid-latitudes buckles and significant cold outbreaks occur, for e.g. in 2013 North America.
Option (d): Ozone depletion occurs within the polar vortices - particularly over the Southern Hemisphere - reaching a maximum depletion in the spring. So, (d) is wrong.

10 As per the Indian Independence Act of 1947, the Governor-general of India was to be

India
b)  Appointed by the Viceroy on the advice of the executive council

His Majesty's Government in Britain was to have no responsibility with respect to the Government of India or Pakistan.
It also abolished the office of the secretary of state for India and transferred his functions to the secretary of state for Commonwealth Affairs.

12 A 'Trickle-down' approach to economic policy making will rely on which of the following?
1.  High tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals
2.  Complete nationalization of the means of production
3.  Improving economic growth rates
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
It is argued by trickle down economists that cutting income tax for the rich will not just benefit high-earners, but also everyone as it generates additional demand and employment in the economy.
Also, increased profits for firms may be reinvested into expanding output. This again leads to higher growth, wages and incomes for all.
Lower income taxes increase the incentive to for people to work leading to higher productivity and economic growth.
So, clearly statement 1 is wrong, and 3 is correct as per the Trickle down economic approach.

13 The Constituent Assembly was constituted in 1946 under the scheme formulated by the
Cabinet Mission Plan. As per the Plan
1.  Each province and princely state was to be allotted seats in proportion to their respective population.

b)  1, 2 and 4 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: A
Statement 1: Roughly, one seat was to be allotted for every million population.
Statement 2: There was no such provision. In fact, the 93 seats allotted to the princely states were not filled as they decided to stay away from the Constituent Assembly.
Statement 3: The representatives of each community were to be elected by members of that community in the provincial legislative assembly and voting was to be by the method of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote.
Statement 4: Seats allocated to each British province were to be decided among the three principal communitiesMuslims, Sikhs and general (all except Muslims and Sikhs), in proportion to their population.

14 Consider the following statements about the external sector.
1.  Assertion (a): Current Account deficit as a percentage of GDP has steadily increased during the last decade.

a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: D
CAD had increased and then steadily decreased during the last decade, and more so in the last 5 years to now nearly 1.5% of GDP. So, A is incorrect.
India had long abolished controls on the current account. It is the capital account which is not fully convertible. So, R is also incorrect.

16 Effective Revenue Deficit is
a)  Revenue deficit minus grants for creation of capital Assets
b)  Revenue receipts adjusted for expenditure on interest payments
c)  Fiscal deficit minus revenue expenditure
d)  Revenue deficit minus plan allocation to States and UTs
Answer: A
Broadly, the expenditure which does not result in creation of assets for the Government of India, is treated as revenue expenditure.
All grants given to the State Governments/Union Territories and other parties are also treated as revenue expenditure even though some of the grants may be used for creation of capital assets.
Revenue expenditure which results in the creation of capital assets is reduced from revenue deficit to arrive at the effective revenue deficit (ERD).

17 Which of the following erstwhile provinces had the largest membership in the
Constituent Assembly of India?

18 In ancient Indian Buddhist monasteries, a ceremony called Pavarana used to be held. It was the
a)  Occasion to elect the Sanghaparinayaka and two speakers one on Dhamma and the other on Vinaya
b)  Confession by monks of their offences committed during their stay in the monasteries during the rainy season
c)  Ceremony of initiation of new person into the Buddhist Sangha in which the head is shaved an when yellow robes are offered
d)  Gathering of Buddhist monks on the next day to the full moon day of
Ashadha when they take up affixed abode for the next four months or rainy season
Answer: B
Pavarana is a Buddhist holy day celebrated on Aashvin full moon of the lunar month.
It marks the end of the 3 lunar months of Vassa, sometimes called "Buddhist Lent."
This day marks the end of the rainy season in some Asian countries like Thailand, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced.
On this day, each monk must come before the community of monks (Sangha) and atone for an offense he may have committed during the Vassa.
Most Mahayana Buddhists do not observe Vassa, though many Son/Thien monks in Korea and Vietnam do observe an equivalent retreat of three months of intensive practice in one location.

19 Consider the following about the federal structure of India.
1.  The Indian federal structure is the result of an agreement between the states.
2.  All states have a legitimate right to secede from the federation by legislative means.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
The term 'Federation' has nowhere been used in the Constitution. Article 1 describes India as a 'Union of States'.
This implies two things: one, Indian Federation is not the result of an agreement by the states; and two, no state has the right to secede from the federation. So, a secessionist movement by say the state of Nagaland is not legitimate and constitutional.
Both statements 1 and 2 are wrong.
Hence, the Indian Constitution has been variously described as 'federal in form but unitary in spirit'.

26 The victor of this Battle took Bihar province in the end of 12th Century, eradicating Buddhism in that area, and later in early 13th Century, his army completed the occupation of the province of Bengal. The battle was
a)  Battle of Tarain
b)  Battle of chausa
c)  Battle of Chausa
d)  Battle of Panipat
Answer: A
The battles were fought in 1191 and 1192 near the town of Tarain (Taraori), near Thanesar in present-day Haryana, between a Ghurid force led by Mu'izz al-Din and a Chauhan Rajput army led by Prithviraj Chauhan.
In the Second Battle of Tarian, Prithviraj Chauhan was defeated by Mohammed
Ghori.
The Second Battle of Tarain 1192 A.D. destroyed the imperial power of the
Chauhan Dynasty.
The subsequent attempts of the Hindu kings to resist the Muslim tide proved futile. Muslim power was strongly founded in Northern India after the battle. Thus the Second battle of Tarain 1192 A.D. may be regarded as a turning point in Indias history.

36 Which of the following is the central difference between the economic philosophies of
Socialism and Communism?
a)  State v/s non-state ownership of factors of production
b)  Right of labour
c)  Central v/s decentralized planning
d)  Role of market in delivering social services

 Socialistic economy emphasises the collective ownership of the means of production (property and assets). It also ascribes a large role to the state in running the economy.
Communist economy on the other hand advocates state ownership of all properties including even labour and absolute power to state in running the economy.
So, the most appropriate option is (a).

37 Consider the following about the writ of Mandamus.
1.  It is used to prevent usurpation of public offices by ineligible individuals.
2.  It cannot be issued against public executive authorities.
3.  It cannot be issued by the lower courts.

38 The 1857 revolt did NOT spread to which of the following parts of the country?
1.  Lucknow
2.  Allahabad
3.  Kashmir
4.  Travancore
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  4 only
Answer: A
 In some regions of Company-controlled India, such as Bengal, the
Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency, remained largely calm.
In Punjab, the Sikh princes backed the Company by providing soldiers and support. The large princely states of Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well
as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion.
In some regions, such as Oudh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against European presence.

39 If a person's "Right to Vote" is infringed, what remedy does she he have?
a)  Move the Supreme Court citing violation of fundamental rights
b)  File a non-judicial petition with the Election Commission of India
c)  File a case against the Chief Electoral Officer of the State
d)  Move the High court for infringement of a constitutional right
Answer: D
 Right to Vote is a constitutional right, not a fundamental right. So, SC
cannot be approached for issuing a writ petition.
High court enforces legal rights, and should be approached in case of its infringement.
ECI only conducts elections and maintains the database of voters. It does not have the authority to enforce the Right to Vote. Same is true for the Chief Electoral Officer.

40 The Regulating Act of 1773 is said to be of great constitutional importance in India. Which of the following can be the reason(s) for it?
1.  It created a federal architecture to govern India decentralizing the administrative system
2.  It transferred control of India from commercial companies to a British government representative in India.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 It was the first step taken by the British Government to control and regulate the affairs of the East India Company in India, and it recognised, for the first time, the political and administrative functions of the Company. So, 2 is clearly wrong. The transfer of control happened late in 1858.
Also, the act laid the foundations of central administration in India. There was neither a provision to decentralize the administration nor creating a federation of autonomous states. So, 1 is wrong too.
You can read the exact provisions from the Q Source.

41 In economics, the term 'invisible hand' is often used in the context of
a)  Indirect effects of government policy on employment and output
b)  Self-correcting quality of the market
c)  Welfare orientation of the State
d)  Role of regulatory mechanisms in preventing market failures
Answer: B
 According to the invisible hand theory, each of us, acting in our own
self-interests, generates a demand for goods and services that compels others to deliver those goods and services in the most efficient manner so that they may be able to receive compensation from others and make a profit in doing so.
In this process, resources are allocated in the most efficient manner, in contrast to a process that relies on a centrally planned system.

42 How is the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (SC) different from that of a High
Court (HC)?

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental rights whereas a high court can issue writs not only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights but also for any other purpose.
Statement 2: The Supreme Court can issue writs aga-inst a person or government throughout the territory of India whereas a high court can issue writs against a person residing or against a government or authority located within its territorial
jurisdiction only or outside its territorial jurisdiction only if the cause of action arises within its territorial jurisdiction.

1.  Optimal allocation of goods and services
2.  Resource efficient production
3.  Reaching equal income levels for all economic agents
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Statement 1: It is when goods and services are distributed according to consumer preferences and needs of corporations.
Statement 2: It is when the maximum number of goods and services are produced with a given amount of inputs.
Statement 3: All agents may not equal incomes, and yet the economic system can be most efficient. So, 3 is wrong.

44 If a ship moves from seawater to freshwater, it will
a)  Sink down a little bit
b)  Rise above the water a little bit
c)  Remain unaffected
d)  Stop floating on water surface
Answer: A
 The ship is floated by the buoyant force of the water upwards.
It is proportional to the density of water. Higher the density, like seawater, greater is the upward force on the ship (cancelling its weight downwards), and higher it its level.
Freshwater has lower density, hence the ship will sink down a little bit.

World War
b)  Partition of India based on a referendum
c)  Setting up provisional governments in the Princely states
d)  Abolition of the system of communal electorates if India participated in the

67 The higher the concentration of the mineral in rocks, the more economical it is to mine it. Which of the following processes help in the concentration of minerals on earth?
1.  Hydrothermal deposits
2.  Weathering
3.  Water erosion
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Hydrothermal deposits are produced when groundwater circulates to depth and heats up either by coming near a hot igneous body at depth or by circulating to great depth along the geothermal gradient.
Such hot water can dissolve valuable substances throughout a large volume of rock. As the hot water moves into cooler areas of the crust, the dissolved substances are precipitated from the hot water solution.
Statement 2: During chemical weathering and original body of rock is greatly reduced in volume by the process of leaching, which removes ions from the original rock. Elements that are not leached form the rock thus occur in higher concentration in the residual rock.
Statement 3: The velocity of flowing water determines whether minerals are carried in suspension or deposited. For e.g. when the velocity of the water slows, large minerals or minerals with a higher density are deposited.

68 The Indian Constitution establishes certain independent bodies like Election
Commission of India, Union Service Public Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General of India. How does it secure their independence from the government?

3.  These bodies are not legal entities like the government.
4.  The government cannot take any action against these bodies or their office holders.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  1, 2 and 4 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
Statement 1: The President appoints the CAG, CEC of India and
Chairman of UPSC. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: The expenses of these bodies and their office holders e.g. CAG of
India, are charged on the consolidated fund of India. So, 2 is wrong.
Statement 3: They are legal entities and can be sued just as the government can be sued.
Statement 4: The government can initiate disciplinary action against the office holders for malpractices, corruption etc. So, 4 is also wrong.
The Constitution ensures the independence of these bodies through various provisions like security of tenure, fixed service conditions, expenses being charged
on the Consolidated Fund of India, and so on.

69 A cloudburst is an extreme amount of precipitation. It can be caused due to
1.  Collision of heavy clouds with mountains
2.  Mixing of warm air parcel with cooler air resulting in sudden condensation
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Apart from the conditions mentioned in the question:
Cloud burst is actually a situation when the inter-molecular forces between the H2O molecules get very high due to the rapid decrease in the temperature or excess of electrostatic induction in the clouds causing the lighting to remain inside the cloud only, which causes hyperactive energy inside the cloud.
The water molecules get denser and denser and get condensed but do not leave the cloud due to excess of electroforces.
As the water concentration get higher and higher and so the weight gets heavier the water no longer is able to maintain force with the clouds and so they fall and it precipitates.

70 Consider the following about Brent Crude which serves as a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide.

Brent Crude is a major trading classification of sweet light crude oil that serves as a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide.
This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulphur content. Brent Crude is extracted from the North Sea and comprises Brent Blend, Forties Blend, Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes.
OPEC Basket, is a weighted average of prices for petroleum blends produced by
OPEC countries.
The OPEC Basket, including a mix of light and heavy crudes, is heavier than both
Brent crude oil, and West Texas Intermediate crude oil.

71 Heavy Water has applications as

75 If the difference between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Net Domestic Product
(NDP) is very less for an economy, what can it imply?
a)  The economy is growing at a very slow rate.
b)  The economy can be technologically advanced.
c)  The economy has low natural resource base.
d)  Foreign investments form a major chunk of investments in the economy.
Answer: B
 NDP = GDP - Depreciation
So it is basically the GDP minus the total value of the 'wear and tear' (depreciation)
that happened in the assets while the goods and services were being produced.
The governments of the economies decide and announce the rates by which assets depreciate (done in India by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) and a list is published, which is used by the different sections of the economy to determine the real levels of depreciations in different assets.
So, if the depreciation levels are low, it may show the achievements of the economy in the area of research and development which have tried cutting the levels of depreciation in a historical time period.

80 The Roaring Forties are strong westerly winds found in the Southern Hemisphere. They are caused due to
1.  Air being displaced from the Equator towards the South Pole
2.  Earth's rotation
3.  Equatorial counter-currents
4.  Thermal dipole created in the Pacific Ocean
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 3 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: C
Hot air rises at the Equator and is pushed towards the poles by cooler air travelling towards the Equator (an atmospheric circulation feature known as the Hadley Cell).
At about 30 degrees from the equator, the outward-travelling air sinks to lower altitudes, and continues toward the poles closer to the ground (the Ferrel Cell), then rises up again from about 60 degrees as the air joins the Polar vortex.
This travel in the 30 to 60 degree zone combines with the rotation of the earth to move the air currents from west to east, creating westerly winds.

81 The Government of India Act of 1935 marked a major milestone towards establishing a
'responsible government' in India. What do you understand by 'responsible government' in this context?
a)  The Governor was required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature.
b)  Government of India took major steps in promoting the welfare of vulnerable sections of Indian population
c)  The Viceroy, Governor and Ministers would conduct themselves strictly based on laws
d)  Bureaucracy will act as per the instructions of the elected representatives
instead of the Governor and Viceroy
Answer: A
Responsible government is a system which embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, such as in India.
It is also the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Government is responsible to the parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a
colonial context, to the imperial government.
If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house.

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
The state under the Delhi sultan was Islamic only in a formal sense.
This means that the sultans did not allow any open violation of the Islamic law and appointed Muslim divines to profitable offices of state and granted them revenue- free lands.
But the sultans did not allow the Muslim divines to dictate the policy of the state. though they could not rule in complete disregard of the views and wishes of these theologians.
And also the sultans had to supplement the Muslim law by framing their own regulations. That is why, the contemporary historian. Barani, refused to consider the state in India as truly Islamic, but one based on worldly or secular considerations (jahandan).

90 Launching an artificial satellite in which of the following ways would save effort?
1.  Launching it from equator instead of poles
2.  Launching it in eastward direction instead of westward direction
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: Radius on poles is smaller than its radius on equators. The away we move from centre of earth, lower is the gravitational force and this is the reason that the gravitational pull is minimum at Equator. So, Equator or the
places near to equator are found suitable for launching the satellites as it will save
efforts.
Statement 2: Earth rotes from west to east, the satellites are launched in Eastward direction so that the speed of earth's rotation which comes nearly 462 meters per second will provide it additional push.

91 The writ of Certiorari is issued by
a)  A higher court to a lower court or tribunal
b)  Judiciary to the executive

Answer: A
 It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case pending with the latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a case. It is issued on the grounds of excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or error of law.
Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive, certiorari is both preventive as well as curative.
Certiorari is not available against legislative bodies and private individuals or bodies.

97 Consider the following statements with regard to the Indian capitalist class in the Indian national movement:
1.  It preferred mass civil disobedience as opposed to the constitutional forms of struggle.
2.  It was against the ideology of imperialism.
Which of these is/are true?
a)  Only 1
b)  Only 2
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 The Indian capitalist class had its own notions of how the anti- imperialist struggle ought to be waged.
It was always in favour of not completely abandoning the constitutional path and the negotiating table and generally preferred to put its weight behind constitutional
forms of struggle as opposed to mass civil disobedience. So, 1 is correct. This was due to several reasons.
First, there was the fear that mass civil disobedience, especially if it was prolonged, would unleash forces which could turn the movement revolutionary in a social sense (i.e., threaten capitalism itself).
Second, the capitalists were unwilling to support a prolonged all-out hostility to the government of the day as it prevented the continuing of day-to-day business and threatened the very existence of the class.

98 Special drawing rights can be used to
1.  Settle Balance of Payment transactions
2.  Augment Foreign Exchange Reserves
3.  Fund infrastructure projects
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
It cannot be used to fund infrastructure projects as it is not a currency.
In some international treaties and agreements, XDRs are used to value penalties, charges or prices.
The Montreal Convention and other treaties also use XDRs in this way.
It also forms a part of India's Forex reserves. However, the contribution is relatively small when compared to currency reserves of foreign nations.

99 Consider the following statements about General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR):
1.  It applies to indirect taxes only.
2.  It will be applicable only when one of the main purposes of the transaction is to avoid taxes.
Which of these is/are true?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 In India, the proposed Direct Tax Code 2010 (DTC 2010 or Code) seeks to address the issues relating to tax avoidance and evasion by bringing in General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) in addition to various transaction-specific Special Anti-Avoidance provisions.
However, where tax benefit is to be considered as the sole criterion (as is currently recognized under the proposed new Code) for determining tax avoidance, such a provision may undermine the common denominator in determination of a tax avoidance scheme, i.e., the principle that though the taxpayer is free to choose the most tax efficient method, the commercial justification for the choice taken and tax consideration (benefit) is not the only reason.

100 The "National treatment" policy advocated by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
means
1.  Imported goods should be treated no less favorably than domestically produced goods.
2.  Foreign companies must enjoy the same funding and protection by the government
as domestic industries.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Statement 1: This was introduced to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).
Statement 2: There are certain limits on supporting domestic industry so that it does not harm the interest of the foreign companies operating in a nation. However, no clause states that they should enjoy the same funding and protection by the government as domestic industries.
