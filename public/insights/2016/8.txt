1 India may soon become a net importer of Arabica coffee as the shift in coffee production in India from Arabica to Robusta has been dramatic. Which of the following may be its reason(s)?
1.  The rising cost of cultivation of Arabica due to lack of any scientific breakthrough in control of white stem borer
2.  Government has preferentially subsidized Robusta growers rather than Arabica growers
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The area under Arabica shrunk from 73 per cent in 1950-51 to about
49 per cent of the total area under coffee in 2012-13. The rising cost of cultivation of Arabica due to lack of any scientific breakthrough in control of white stem borer and coffee leaf rust has been the major reason.
This has led to decline in overall production or Arabica due to low yields and shifting of growers to Robusta. So, 1 is correct.
Moreover, the Centre did not appoint a full-time chairman for Coffee Board of India for a long time.

2 Consider the following about Fahien's account of the Gupta administration.
1.  He characterised the Gupta administration as despotic and malevolent.
2.  There was no individual liberty in personal and cultural sphere as they were heavily regulated by the state.
3.  He appreciated the efficiency of the Gupta administration as he was able to travel without any fear throughout the Gangetic valley.
4.  There was widespread poverty and frequent famines.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2 and 3 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: C
  The famous Chinese pilgrim, Fahien visited India during the reign of Chandragupta II. Out of his nine years stay in India, he spent six years
in the Gupta empire.
Statement 1: He characterises the Gupta administration as mild and benevolent
Statement 2: There were no restrictions on people's movements and they enjoyed a large degree of personal freedom. There was no state interference in the individual's life.
Statements 3 and 4: The administration was so efficient that the roads were kept safe for travellers (he was able to travel without any fear throughout the Gangetic
valley), and there was no fear of thieves. He mentioned that people were generally prosperous and the crimes were negligible. So, 3 and 4 are correct.

3 Which of the following can increase agricultural productivity per unit land in India?
1.  Greater use of capital equipments
2.  Increasing water logging of field
3.  Making the soil highly alkaline
4.  Using irrigation instead of depending on rain-fed water
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: C
 Greater use of capital equipments or mechanization of agriculture increases output per labour per unit land. So, 1 is correct.
In agriculture, various crops need air (specifically, oxygen) to a greater or lesser depth in the soil. Waterlogging (saturation of soil with water) stops air getting in and
thus reduces crop produce. So, 2 is incorrect.
Alkaline soils are difficult to take into agricultural production. Due to the low infiltration capacity, rain water stagnates on the soil easily and, in dry periods, cultivation is hardly possible without copious irrigated water and good drainage. So,
3 is incorrect.

4 Special safeguard mechanism (SSM) as under WTO relates to
a)  Allowing developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily to deal with import surges or price falls
b)  Support for farmers that is not linked to prices or production
c)  Licensing companies or individuals other than the patent owner to use the rights of the patent
d)  Governments recognizing other countries' measures as acceptable even if they are different from their own, so long as an equivalent level of protection
is provided
Answer: A
 WTO's Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) is a protection measure allowed for developing countries to take contingency restrictions against agricultural imports that are causing injuries to domestic farmers.
The contingency measure is imposition of tariff if the import surge causes welfare loss to the domestic poor farmers. The design and use of the SSM is an area of conflict under the WTO.
At the Doha Ministerial Conference, the developing countries were given a concession to adopt a Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) besides the existing safeguards (like the Special Agricultural Safeguard or the SSG). This SSM constituted an important part of the promises offered to the developing world at Doha (known as Doha Development Agenda) and the Doha MC became known as a development round.
The SSG was available to all countries- both developing and developed whereas the
SSM is allowable only to the developing countries.

5 The three principles or Triratnas of Jainism are right faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Out of them 'right knowledge' means?
a)  Acceptance of the theory that there is no God and that the world has been existing without a creator.
b)  Both the clergy and laymen must understand their role in spiritual life and strictly follow the doctrine of ahimsa.
c)  Unshaken belief in the teachings and wisdom of Mahavira
d)  That human life is not a means towards salvation
Answer: A
 Option (b) points to Right Conduct. Option (c) points to Right Faith
Theme in Option (d) was not explicitly mentioned by Jain followers or Jainism
 Mahavira regarded all objects, both animate and inanimate, have souls and various degrees of consciousness. They possess life and feel pain when they are injured.
Even the practice of agriculture was considered sinful as it causes injury to the earth, worms and animals. Similarly the doctrine of asceticism and renunciation was also carried to extreme lengths by the practice of starvation, nudity and other forms of
self-torture.

6 Which of the following may be indicated by 'deflation' in the economy?
a)  GDP of the country has been growing at a negative growth rate.
b)  Prices of all goods must have declined
c)  The Central bank is following an easy monetary policy.
d)  The demand in the economy is weak or supply is excess.
Answer: D
  In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). This should not be confused with disinflation, a slow- down in the inflation rate (i.e., when inflation declines to lower levels).
So, in a situation of deflation GDP may be growing, reducing or constant. Option (a)
is wrong.
Deflation shows a general decline in prices of goods. It is not necessary that prices of all goods must have declined. So, (b) is not appropriate.
If Central bank follows an easy monetary policy, demand will be strong, and inflation is more likely than deflation. So, (c) is wrong.
Most appropriate option is (d) since prices of goods may decline if demand decreases given constant supply of goods. If demand is too weak, prices may reduce heavily.

7 The "commanding heights" of the economy was a term attributed to which of the following in post-independent India?
a)  Pivotal role to the public sector units in the Indian economy
b)  Liberalization of markets to achieve higher economic growth
c)  The strategy of import substitution followed by the Government
d)  Collectivization of agriculture undertaken in the 1960s
Answer: A
 The Economic Model of India assigned a pivotal role to its public sector, which came to control "commanding heights" of the economy after the Indian parliament adopted a resolution in 1956 to achieve a "socialistic pattern of society" as a national goal.
In pursuance to this goal, a large number of public sector units (PSUs) were set up in different sectors of the economy.
The expansion of the public sector did not take place only in a traditional direction i.e. (correct provision of public goods and infrastructure), but also to non-traditional command over the economy, in particular: (a) Nationalization to occupy the
"commanding heights" of the economy and regulations to protect them from internal and foreign competition, (b) Widespread subsidies, explicit and implicit, and (c) Administered prices and related regulations.

8 The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library safeguards which of the following?
1.  Traditional knowledge about medicinal plants
2.  Formulations used in Indian systems of medicine
3.  Yoga asanas
4.  Traditional knowledge about biodiversity
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1, 2 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
 The issue of biopiracy and unethical bioprospecting made headlines after the government of India successfully revoked or limited turmeric and basmati rice patents granted by United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the neem patent granted by European Patent Office (EPO) in the late 1990s. Soon more such patent claims came to light.
India's vast traditional medicine knowledge existed in languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Tamil, making it inaccessible for examiners at international patent offices to verify claims.
This experience prompted the Department of AYUSH, government of India
to create a task force of experts in the areas of traditional medicine systems of India (i.e., Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Yoga), patent examiners, IT experts, scientists and technical officers, for the creation Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL).
It was initiated in 2001. The tasks included, for example, transcribing Sanskrit shlokas which describe an Ayurvedic formulation in text, using Traditional Knowledge Resource Classification (TKRC) devised for the purpose, so that it is easily understandable to any patent examiner, anywhere
in the world. For this reason, the entire 34 million pages of text is available in
English, German, French, Spanish and Japanese.

For this reason, the entire 34 million pages of text is available in English, German, French, Spanish and Japanese.
As the database project reached its completion, in 2006 the government allowed access to the library to international patent offices subject to a non- disclosure clause. This allows patent examiners to evaluate patent applications and stop attempts to patent traditional knowledge as "new" inventions.

9 As a country develops, it undergoes 'structural change'. In the case of India, the structural change is 'peculiar' with regard to its sectoral composition especially services sector. What is so 'peculiar' about this structural change?
a)  Services sector has grown at a slower rate than any other sector of the economy.
b)  Traditionally services sector growth is propelled by the manufacturing sector but in India agricultural sector has propelled services sector growth.
c)  The service sector contributes more to the GDP than agriculture and manufacturing even though India is not a developed country.
d)  Services sector has failed to generate additional employment despite high levels of growth in India.
Answer: C
 Usually, with development, the share of agriculture declines and the share of industry become dominant. At higher levels of development, the service sector contributes more to the GDP than the other two sectors.
In India, the share of agriculture in the GDP was more than 50 per cent—as we would expect for a poor country. But by 1990 the share of the services sector was 41 per cent, more than that of agriculture or industry, like what we find in developed nations.
This phenomenon of growing share of the service sector was accelerated in the post
1991 period and today its accounts for nearly 65% of our GDP. This is the peculiar pattern of Indian growth where services sector has accelerated without the rapid growth and saturation of the manufacturing sector.
So, (c) is correct and (a) is incorrect.
Manufacturing and liberalization have fuelled services sector growth, inter alia. SO, (b) is incorrect.
Manufacturing sector has not generated additional gainful employment, not the services sector. So, (d) is wrong.

10 The Union Cabinet has approved a policy framework for development of Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) in unexplored coal and lignite bearing areas in the country. UCG will convert coal into which of the following product gases?
1.  Methane
2.  Carbon dioxide
3.  Hydrogen
4.  Carbon monoxide
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  3 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
 UCG is a clean coal extraction technology for extracting energy from the coal seams and lignite resources which cannot be mined through traditional mining technology.
It is mainly an industrial process which converts coal into product gases such as methane, hydrogen, CO and CO2 that are combusted for electricity generation.
The gasification process is carried out in non-mined coal seams using injection of oxidants which brings the product gas to surface through production wells drilled from the surface.

11 Consider the following statements about the Rig Vedic Society.
1.  Assertion (a): Unlike men, women were denied opportunities for their spiritual and intellectual development.
2.  Reason (R): The Rig Vedic society was patriarchal.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  A is incorrect but R is correct.
Answer: D
 There were women poets like Apala, Viswavara, Ghosa and Lopamudra during the Rig Vedic period. Women could even attend the popular assemblies. There was no child marriage and the practice of sati was absent. This shows that statement A is wrong.
However, the society was patriarchal. The basic unit of society was family or graham. The head of the family was known as grahapathi. Monogamy was generally practiced while polygamy was prevalent among the royal and noble families. The wife took care of the household and participated in all the major ceremonies. So, R would be correct, and correct answer would be D.

15 How can Arsenic present in groundwater be partially removed?
a)  Treating the water with chlorine
b)  Subjecting the water to repeated cycles of frost and then heating
c)  Repeated boiling of water
d)  Reverse osmosis
Answer: D
 Some of the methods of removing arsenic are:
Both Reverse osmosis and electrodialysis (also called electrodialysis reversal)
can remove arsenic with a net ionic charge.
Coagulation/filtration (also known as flocculation) removes arsenic by coprecipitation and adsorption using iron coagulants.
Iron oxide adsorption filters the water through a granular medium containing ferric oxide. Ferric oxide has a high affinity for adsorbing dissolved metals such as arsenic.
Ion exchange has long been used as a water softening process, although usually on a single-home basis.

16 The "trickle down" strategy of reducing poverty relies on
a)  Providing subsidized basic public services to the poor
b)  Generating gainful employment by public works
c)  Political and social empowerment of the poor
d)  Achieving high economic growth rate
Answer: D
The argument is that promoting economic growth, increases total income in society, creating more jobs and income, which could be redistributed.
This was the major focus of planning in the 1950s and early 1960s.
It was felt that rapid industrial development and transformation of agriculture through green revolution in select regions would benefit the underdeveloped regions and the more backward sections of the community.
However, growth failed to "trickle down" and it widened relative poverty because it benefitted only the highly skilled and wealthy classes more than those at the bottom.

17 Around the time Alexander invaded India, Chandragupta Maurya and Kautilya initiated a popular movement against the Nanda rule. Why was the movement launched?
a)  The oppressive ways of tax collection by Nandas were resented by
people.
b)  Nanda kingdom was financially crippled and unable to withstand any foreign invasion.
c)  Nanda was a weak dynasty which could be usurped for financial gains to Mauryas.
d)  Nandas had colluded with Alexander.
Answer: A
 The enormous wealth of the Nandas is referred to in the Tamil
Sangam work Ahananuru by the poet Mamulanar. So, (b) is incorrect.
Many historians believe that a considerable portion of the Deccan was also under the control of the Nandas.
Nandas never had the opportunity to see their army up against Alexander, who invaded North-western India at the time of Dhana Nanda, since Alexander was forced to confine his campaign to the plains of Punjab and Sindh. So, (d) can't be correct.
The oppressive way of tax collection by Dhana Nanda was resented by the people. Taking advantage of this, Chandragupta Maurya and Kautilya initiated a popular movement against the Nanda rule. It was during this time that Alexander invaded India. So, (a) is correct.

18 If the population of a nation is fixed, how can it increase its human capital?
1.  By investing in health security of citizens
2.  By regulating service conditions in the unorganized sector
3.  By promoting digital literacy
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Health expenditure directly increases the supply of healthy labour force and is, thus, a source of human capital formation. So,
1 is correct.
Statement 2: Service conditions in unorganized sector are poor. There may be no mandatory breaks; ill provision of safety, water, sanitation, hygiene; long working hours etc. reduce productivity of labour. So, regulating service conditions will augment labour safety and health and thus productivity contributing to human capital. So, 2 is correct.
Statement 3: Digital literacy builds IT skills, increases productivity and efficiency of labour and digital information is necessary to make decisions regarding investments in human capital as well as for efficient utilisation of the acquired human capital stock. For e.g. you may want to get information for good educational institutions in India and abroad. So, 3 is correct.

19 'Kudumbashree' of Kerala is a women-oriented community-based poverty reduction programme. It was conceived as a
a)  Joint programme of the Government of Kerala and NABARD
b)  New initiative under the NGO Self-employed Women's Association(SEWa)
c)  Joint programme of the major Women SHGs of Kerala
d)  New initiative of SIDBI, Kerala and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Answer: A
Kudumbashree is formally registered as the "State Poverty Eradication Mission" (SPEM), a society registered under the Travancore Kochi Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Act 1955
Kudumbashree differs from conventional programmes in that it perceives poverty not just as the deprivation of money, but also as the deprivation of basic rights. The poor need to find a collective voice to help claim these rights.
It is this network that brings women to the Grama Sabhas and helps them bring the needs of the poor to the attention of the local governments. The Community Development Societies are also very active in Government
programmes and play significant roles in development activities ranging from socio-economic surveys and enterprise development to community management and social audit.
Though its efforts to engage women in civil society in development issues and opportunities, Kudumbashree in association with the local self government of Kerala is charting out new meaning and possibilities for local economic development and citizen centric governance.

20 What is the difference between 'Greenfield' and 'Brownfield' airport projects?
a)  Greenfield airport are new airports constructed on undeveloped sites, whereas Brownfield airports are upgradation over existing ones.
b)  Brownfield airports are more polluted than Greenfield airports.
c)  Greenfield airports pass ecological benchmarks set by the Civil Aviation authorities, whereas Brownfield airports do not.
d)  Brownfield airports are developed on relatively barren sites, whereas Greenfield airports are developed near dense vegetation to cut noise and pollution.
Answer: A
 Greenfield airports are built from scratch on a new location because the existing airport is unable to meet the traffic requirements.
Brownfield airports modify or upgrade existing facilities.
The same concept is applicable to all industries, for e.g. manufacturing industries where an existing industry may be acquired and developed under FDI without generating any new infrastructure.
Brownfield projects under FDI have been a cause of concern as they increase foreign monopoly in Indian markets without adding to capital formation.

24 Consider the comparison between Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs) and Light
Emitting Diodes (LEDs).
1.  CFLs have generally longer life spans than LEDs.
2.  LEDs use less power per unit of light generated as compared to CFLs.
3.  Both CFL and LED contain toxic mercury.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
 The average lifespan of LEDs is around 50,000 hours, whereas that of CFLs is nearly 8,000 hours. So, 1 is incorrect.
CFLs contain toxic mercury, LEDs do not. So, 3 is incorrect.
LEDs use less power (watts) per unit of light generated (lumens). LEDs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and lower electric bills. So, 2 is correct.
 Mercury is a dangerous heavy metal, and proper cleanup and disposal of CFL bulbs is critical.
Like incandescent lamps and unlike most fluorescent lamps (e.g. tubes and compact fluorescent lamps or CFLs), LEDs come to full brightness without need for a warm-up time; the life of fluorescent lighting is also reduced by frequent switching on and off.
The initial cost of LED is usually higher. Degradation of LED dye and packaging materials reduces light output to some extent over time.

25 The first person who provides primary healthcare in rural areas is
a)  Auxiliary Nursing Midwife (ANM)
b)  Accredited social health activists (ASHAs)
c)  Traditional Birth attendants (TBAs)
d)  Gram Swasthya Sewak (GSS)
Answer: A
 ASHA works more as a health activist, information provider, supplement and medicine provider etc rather than the healthcare delivery person. So, (b) is incorrect.
There is no post like Gram Swasthya Sewak (GSS) which has the responsibility for primary health care. So, (d) is wrong.
Traditional Birth attendants (TBAs) attend pregnancy needs and not considered a part of the institutional delivery system. So, (c) is wrong.
A Health Worker (Female)/Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) at each Sub- Centre and Primary Health Centre is kept to attend to primary health needs. So, (a) is correct.
In order to provide primary health care, hospitals have been set up in villages and small towns which are generally manned by a single doctor, a nurse and a limited quantity of medicines. They are known as Primary Health Centres (PHC), Community Health Centres (CHC) and sub-centres. When the condition of a patient is not managed by PHCs, they are referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals.
In some villages, Village health Workers (VHWs) are recruited to deliver services at health care centres.

Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter.
 Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet light from passing through the Earth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern.
This led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol banning the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds, as well as other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethane (also known as methyl chloroform), and bromine compounds known as halons.

29 Productivity of Indian agriculture is lower in India as compared to China. Which of the following can be reason(s)?
1.  China has much larger net sown area and arable land than India.
2.  Chinese farmers do not use mixed cropping systems unlike India.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
India has the second largest amount of arable land of any country after the U.S. Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China's, India's arable land is marginally bigger than China's. So, 1 is anyway incorrect. Moreover, size of total arable land is not linked with productivity.
Mixed cropping systems are actually more efficient, productive and economical than other cropping systems. So, 2 is incorrect.
One possible reason for India's low productivity, whether wheat or rice or any crop, is the small size of individual farm holdings. The 2001 census found that 80% of farm holdings were less than 2 hectares in size, with 62% averaging less than half a hectare.
Both in China and India, small farm sizes inhibit mechanization. But fertilizer usage is much higher in China than India.
In addition, China invests significantly more in agricultural research and development compared to India to produce high-yield and quicker-growing crop varieties. This, along with better irrigation and more intensive cultivation of the land by double or even triple cropping, are the primary reasons for China's superior yields.

37 India agreed to the conditionalities of World Bank and IMF and announced the
New Economic Policy (NEP) 1991 to avert
a)  A Balance of Payments (BoP) crisis
b)  A situation of hyperinflation in the economy
c)  A situation of monetary depression in the Indian economy
d)  The ill spread effects of the Asian Financial Crisis
Answer: A
Foreign exchange reserves in the late 1980s declined to a level that was not adequate to finance imports for more than two weeks. There was also not sufficient foreign exchange to pay the interest that needs to be paid to
international lenders. Therefore, a BoP crisis was looming to avert which
India resorted to the help of WB and IMF. So, (a) is correct.
Hyperinflation is a situation of exceedingly high inflation (likes of
300-5000%). India was not suffering with hyperinflation, however, inflation was high. So, (b) is wrong.
Asian financial crisis happened in 1997 from which India was largely insulated. So, (d) is wrong.
Other objectives of the policy were to tackle high inflation, mismanagement of the economy, revive growth prospects etc. However, the most appropriate reason is to avert a BoP crisis.
The NEP aimed towards creating a more competitive environment in the economy and removing the barriers to entry and growth of firms. It can broadly be classified into two groups: the stabilisation measures and the structural reform measures.
Stabilisation measures are short-term measures, intended to correct some of the weaknesses that have developed in the balance of payments and to bring inflation under control.
On the other hand, structural reform policies are long-term measures, aimed at improving the efficiency of the economy and increasing its international competitiveness by removing the rigidities in various segments of the Indian economy.

38 How do price subsidies induce 'market distortions' in the economy?
1.  Subsidies do not allow prices to indicate the supply of a good.
2.  Subsidies do not allow the market to price a good or service.
Which of the above is/are true?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Statement 1: When electricity and water are provided at a
subsidised rate or free, they will be used wastefully without any concern for their scarcity.
Farmers will cultivate water intensive crops if water is supplied free, although the water resources in that region may be scarce and such crops will further deplete the already scarce resources. If water is priced to reflect scarcity, farmers will cultivate crops suitable to the region. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: Even when diesel and petrol prices were regulated in India, market had the freedom of pricing. The state bore the additional burden of subsidies.
You can take another example of electricity, which is subsidized in India. But, that does not stop private manufacturers (e.g. Reliance) to price electricity at the price they find profitable. So, 2 is incorrect.
Only if the prices are administered, the market loses it pricing power, for e.g. in case of essential medicines.

39 Consider the following statements about Worker-Population Ratio in India.
1.  In rural India, there are more male workers than female workers.
2.  In urban India, there are more female workers than male workers.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
In both urban and rural India, there is a greater proportion of male workers than female workers. So, 1 is correct and 2 is incorrect.
Of the total 402 million workers, 275 million are males and 127 million females. This would mean that 51.7 percent of the total males and
25.6 percent of the total females are workers. The number of female workers
is about less than half the number of male workers. In terms of proportion,
68.4 percent of the workers are males and 31.6 percent females.
Main workers constitute 77.8 percent of the total workers. The remaining are marginal workers. Among the main workers, female workers, are only 23.3 % and 76.7% are male workers.
Majority of female workers (87.3 percent) are from rural areas. This is also twice that of male workers, which may be due to their being employed predominantly in activities like cultivation and agricultural labour. In the urban areas, majority of female workers are engaged in Households industry and other work.
Interestingly, among marginal workers females outnumber the males. In three of the four categories, viz. cultivators, agricultural labourers and household industries, female marginal workers outnumber male workers.

d)  None of the above
Answer: C
Aranyakas are the ritual sacrifice part of the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas. For example, Katha Aranyaka describes rituals such as the Mahavrata and Pravargya.Upanishads are the essence of Hindu philosophy. So, 1 is incorrect.
Gold, iron and copper were known to the Rig Vedic people. So, 2 is correct. The four divisions of society (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyasand Sudras) or
the Varna system was thoroughly established duringthe Later Vedic period.
So, 3 is incorrect.

been lost due to foreign invasionslike that of Huns.
The temple at Deogarh near Jhansi and the sculptures in the temple at Garhwas near Allahabad remain important specimen of the Gupta art. The Buddha statue unearthed at Saranath was unique piece of Gupta art. The Bhitari monolithic pillar of Skandagupta is also remarkable. Metallurgy had also made a wonderful progress during the Gupta period.
The gigantic copper statue of Buddha, originally found at Sultanganj now kept at Birmingham museum, was about seven and a half feet height and nearly a ton weight.
The Delhi Iron pillar of the Gupta period is still free from rust though completely exposed to sun and rain for so many centuries.
The paintings of the Gupta period are seen at Bagh caves near Gwalior. The mural paintings of Ajantha mostly illustrate the life of the Buddha as depicted in the Jataka stories.

48 In the beginning of the 6th century B.C., the northern Indiaconsisted of a large number of independent kingdoms, some of which wererepublics. In the republics, the power of decision in all matters of state vested with the

b)  The elected ruler who was accountable to the kingdom council
c)  A small council of seniormost citizens of the state headed by the local monarch
d)  Public Assembly which was composed of the tribalrepresentatives or
heads of families
Answer: D
 Some of the republics consisted of only one tribe like the Sakyas, Licchavis and Mallas.
All decisions were by amajority vote.
Apart from republics, there were also monarchical forms of government. The Buddhist literature Anguttara Nikaya gives a list of sixteengreat kingdoms called 'Sixteen Mahajanapadas'.
In course of time, the small and weak kingdoms eithersubmitted to the stronger rulers or gradually got eliminated. Finallyin the mid 6th century
b)C., only four kingdoms – Vatsa, Avanti,Kosala and Magadha survived.

 Statement 1: It originated during the reign of Indo-Greek rulers but the real patrons of this school of art were the Sakas and the Kushanas, particularly Kanishka. So, 1 will be correct.
Statement 2: The Gandhara school made sculptures of the Buddha in various sizes, shapes and postures. The reliefs depict Buddha's birth, his renunciation and his preaching. It was the Mathura school which carved female figures. So, 2 is wrong.
Statement 3: The home of the Gandhara school of art is the territory in and around Peshawar in northwestern India. It is the Mathura school that was based in UP. So, 3 is wrong.

58 Consider the following about El Nino Modoki .
1.  It is associated with strong anomalous warming in the central tropical Pacific and cooling in the eastern and western tropical Pacific.
2.  Unlike normal El Nino, El Nino Modoki does not influence rain patterns.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 El Nino Modoki is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the tropical Pacific. It is different from another coupled phenomenon in the tropical Pacific namely, El Nino. Conventional El Nino is characterized by
strong anomalous warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific.
However, El Nino Modoki is associated with strong anomalous warming in the central tropical Pacific and cooling in the eastern and western tropical Pacific. Associated with this distinct warming and cooling patterns the teleconnections are very different from teleconnection patterns of the conventional El Nino.
The El Niño Modoki significantly influences regional climates in China, Japan and US.

59 The Chalcolithic age is followed by 'X' age. X is frequently referred to in the
Vedas. 'X' can be
a)  Middle Stone
b)  Iron
c)  Copper-stone
d)  Palaeolithic
Answer: B
 The Chalcolithic age is followed by Iron Age. Iron is frequently referred to in the Vedas. The Iron Age of the southern peninsula is often related to Megalithic Burials. Megalith means Large Stone. The burial pits were covered with these stones. Such graves are extensively found in South India.
The early period of the age is characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel. The adoption of these materials coincided with other changes in society, including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles.

60 The drawbacks of chlorine disinfection of water are
1.  Chlorine can react with naturally occurring organic compounds found in the water supply to produce undesirable compounds.
2.  Chlorine has a volatile nature which causes it to disappear too quickly from the water system.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 As in statement 1, in high doses, some of these undesirable compounds like bromoform mainly slow down regular brain activity, which is manifested by symptoms such as sleepiness or sedation.
Chronic exposure of both bromoform and dibromochloromethane can cause liver and kidney cancer, as well as heart disease, unconsciousness, or death in high doses.
Due to the potential carcinogenicity of these compounds, drinking water regulations across the developed world require regular monitoring of the concentration of these compounds in the distribution systems of municipal water systems.

61 In a mixed economy model
a)  Both the market and State provide for goods and services
b)  All factor ownership is vested with the state while distribution is vested with the private sector
c)  Market owns all the factors but State regulates their usage
d)  The government decides how goods are to be produced and how they should be distributed
Answer: A
 Option (d) is a socialistic system where the government decides what goods are to be produced in accordance with the needs of society, as it is believed the government best knows what people need the most.
The economic system in Option (b) is not practiced. It borrows some features of both communism and capitalism.
In a mixed economy, market does not own all factors, as the state too may
own labour, land (e.g. railways) etc. So, (c) is wrong.
 Most economies are mixed economies, i.e., the government and the market together answer the three questions of what to produce, how to produce and how to distribute what is produced. In a mixed economy, the market will provide whatever goods and services it can produce well, and the government will provide essential goods and services which the market fails to do.

c)  2 only
d)  3 only
Answer: D
 Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is a Statutory body under Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, regulating the public exhibition of films under the provisions of the Cinematograph Act 1952. So,
1 and 2 are incorrect.
The Certification process is in accordance with The Cinematograph Act,
1952, The Cinematograph (certification) Rules, 1983, and the guidelines issued by the Central government.
At present films are certified under 4 categories: U: Unrestricted Public Exhibition;

64 A Khap Panchayat is
a)  a sub-body formed under Gram Panchayat
b)  an assembly of elders of a group of related clan
c)  a community organization affiliated with the formally elected government bodies
d)  affiliated with the democratically elected local assemblies wielding
local authority
Answer: B
 Khap is a clan or a group of related clan, mainly among the Jats of
Western UP and Haryana. A Khap Panchayat is an assembly of Khap elders.
It is unaffiliated with the formally elected government bodies. A Khap Panchayat is concerned with the affairs of the Khap it represents. It is not affiliated with the democratically elected local assemblies that are also termed Panchayat.
A Khap panchayat has not official government recogition or authority, but can exert significant social influence within the community they represent
The Khap panchayts frequently deliberate on social issues to attempt to combat social problems like female abortions, alcohol abuse, dowry, rape etc.
The Supreme Court has declared illegal 'Khap panchayats' which often decree or encourage honour killings or other institutionalised atrocities against boys and girls of different castes and religions who wish to get married or have married

65 The Chinese travelers of ancient India mentioned a number of educational institutions including the very famous University of Nalanda. It was established during the
a)  Gandharan Kambojas Period
b)  Gupta Period
c)  Satavahana Period
d)  Harsha Period
Answer: B
 It was founded by Kumaragupta I during the Gupta period. It was patronised by his successors and later by Harsha.
Though it was a Mahayana University, different religious subjects like the Vedas, Hinayana doctrine, Sankhya and Yoga philosophies were also taught. In addition to that, general subjects like logic, grammar, astronomy, medicine and art were in the syllabus.
It attracted students not only from different parts of India but from different countries of the east. Admission was made by means of an entrance examination.
Nalanda University was a residential university and education was free including the boarding and lodging.

66 The Brahmadeya and Devadhana lands under the Pallava Kingdom were those lands that were
a)  Declared of divine origin
b)  Exempted from tax
c)  Maintained by the village assembly
d)  Granted to the marginalized and extremely poor
Answer: B
 The Pallavas had a well organized administrative system. The King provided land-grants to the temples known as Devadhana and also to the Brahmans known as Brahmadeya.
Land tax was the primary source of the government revenue. The
Brahmadeya and Devadhana lands were exempted from tax.
 Traders and artisans such as carpenters, goldsmiths, washer-men, oil-pressers and weavers paid taxes to the government. The Pallava inscriptions throw much light on the village assemblies called sabhas and their committees. They maintained records of all village lands, looked after local affairs and managed temples.

67 The Tripitakas of Buddhism are known as the Sutta, the Vinaya and the
Abhidhamma Pitakas. Out of them, Abhidhamma Pitakas contain
a)  Rules and regulations of monastic life ranging from dress code and dietary rules to prohibitions of certain personal conducts
b)  Philosophical and psychological discourse and interpretation of
Buddhist doctrine
c)  Teachings attributed to the Buddha or his close companions
d)  Contemporary research into the fundamental Buddhist ideas available in different languages
Answer: B
 Option (a) is Vinaya Pitaka. Option (c) is Sutta.
The Abhidhamma Pitaka is a detailed scholastic reworking (interpretation and comment) of material appearing in the Suttas, according to schematic classifications. It does not contain systematic philosophical treatises, but summaries or enumerated lists. So, (b) is correct.
 Abhidhamma has been variously described as philosophy, psychology, and metaphysics.
Tradition holds that the Buddha thought out the Abhidhamma immediately after his enlightenment then taught it to the gods some years later. Later the Buddha repeated it to Sariputta who then handed it on to his disciples.
Scholars, however, generally date the Abhidhamma works to originating sometime around the third century BCE, 100 to 200 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the seven Abhidhamma works are generally claimed by scholars not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, but those of disciples and scholars.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Statement 1: The Baily's beads effect is a feature of total solar eclipses. As the moon "grazes" by the Sun during a solar eclipse, the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some places, and not in others.
Statement 2: The diamond ring effect is seen when only one bead is left; a shining diamond set in a bright ring around the lunar silhouette.
Statement 3: It is related to general relativity.

70 What was the implication of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 for the Indian
economy?
a)It further intensified British control over India's foreign trade. 
b)It reduced the sale of indentured Indian labour in Europe.
c)It severely eroded British monopoly in several parts of the world reducing its investments and trade with India.
d)It helped trade shift from India's western coasts to India's eastern coasts.
Answer: A
 The Suez Canal provides a direct trade route for ships operating between European or American ports and ports located in South Asia, East Africa and Oceania by doing away with the need to sail around Africa. Its opening in 1869 reduced the cost of transportation and made access to the Indian market easier. Thus, option (a) is correct and (c) is incorrect.
Option (b) is not correct, as indentured labourers were mostly exported to the
British colonies, which did not require the use of Suez Canal.
Suez Canal gave the western coasts an advantage over the eastern coasts as ship load could be sent right across Europe to Middle East and western India. So, (d) is wrong.

71 Which of the following is/are part(s) of the formal credit system in rural areas?
1.  Regional rural banks (RRBs)
2.  Land Development Banks
3.  Scheduled Commercial Banks
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Regional Rural Banks are local level banking organizations. They have been created with a view to serve primarily the rural areas of India with basic banking and financial services. However, RRB's
may have branches set up for urban operations and their area of operation may include urban areas too.
Statement 2: It is a special kind of bank in India, and is of quasi-commercial type that provides services such as accepting deposits, making business loans, and offering basic investment products. The main objective of the LDB is to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDB provides long-term finance to members directly
through its branches.
Statement 3: The scheduled commercial banks are those banks which are included in the second schedule of RBI Act 1934 and which carry out the normal business of banking such as accepting deposits, giving out loans and other banking services. Many lend in rural areas.

72 Which of the following cities is known as India's healthcare capital attracting highest numbers of health tourists from domestic circles as well as abroad?
a)  Mumbai
b)  Delhi
c)  Chennai
d)  Thiruvananthapuram
Answer: C
 Chennai attracts about 45 percent of health tourists from abroad arriving in the country and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.
Factors behind the tourists inflow in the city include low costs, little to no waiting period, and facilities offered at the specialty hospitals in the city.
The city has an estimated 12,500 hospital beds, of which only half is used by the city's population with the rest being shared by patients from other states of the country and foreigners.
Dental clinics have also attracted dental care tourism to Chennai.
The statistics also show that TN attracted the third highest number of domestic tourists in 2009.

73 'Import substitution' can be achieved by
1.  Imposing tariffs and quotas on selected imports
2.  Encouraging Foreign Direct investment (FDI) in the country in select sectors
3.  Providing subsidies to export based enterprises in the country
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: A
 This policy aimed at replacing or substituting imports with domestic production.
Statement 1: In this policy the government protected the domestic industries from foreign competition, so that the same goods that are now imported can
be produced domestically. Protection from imports can take two forms: tariffs and quotas. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 2: The best example would be 'Make In India' rather than 'Import to India'. Firms that used to export goods and services like mobile phones would manufacture in India itself after FDI. This would reduce imports and build domestic manufacturing base. So, 2 is correct.
Statement 3: Export based industries are meant to generate an export surplus in the goods they export (e.g. Gem and Jewelleries). If such industries are subsidized, they will not substitute imports from abroad (as they don't manufacture those goods), and would actually boost exports. So, 3 is incorrect.
An argument can be made that increased exports (as under 3) would help generate precious foreign exchange which could be used to fund other
industries and thus promote import substitution. But, this is a remote argument to the question, and practically any activity that generates revenue would then help in import substitution, which is not a correct proposition.

74 The primary cause for the rise of Jainism and Buddhism in the 6th century B.C. India was the
a)  Support of the Brahmin priestly class
b)  Political and economic crisis in the Magadha Kingdom
c)  Religious unrest in India due to growing resentment with existing religions
d)  Revolt of the priestly class which earlier received royal patronage
Answer: C
 The complex rituals and sacrifices advocated in the Later Vedic period were not acceptable to the common people. The sacrificial ceremonies were also found to be too expensive. The superstitious beliefs and mantras confused the people.
The teachings of Upanishads, an alternative to the system of sacrifices, were highly philosophical in nature and therefore not easily understood by all. This contributed to a sort of religious unrest in India. So, answer is (c).
There was no such crisis in the Magadha kingdom, So, (b) is incorrect. Other than the religious factor, social and economic factors also contributed
to the rise of these two religions.
The rigid caste system prevalent in India generated tensions in the society. Higher classes enjoyed certain privileges which were denied to the lower classes. Also, the Kshatriyas had resented the domination of the priestly class. It should also to be noted that both Buddha and Mahavira belonged to Kshatriya origin. So, (a) and (d) are not appropriate here.

75 The la
a)  Afghanistan
b)  Tanzania
c)  Syria
d)  Russia
Answer: A
 During the 10th ministerial conference in the Nairobi, Kenya two new members were added viz. Liberia (163rd) and Afghanistan (164th).
By joining WTO, landlocked war-shattered Afghanistan hopes to reap the benefits of the WTO membership for its post-conflict reconstruction.
Trade-led growth will help to create new economic opportunities in world's poorest economy and create jobs especially for women and in turn help to reduce poverty.
Post-conflict reconstruction will certainly contribute in a major way to reduce extremism and achieve regional peace and security.

77 The policy makers of independent India laid stress on land Reforms to promote growth and equity in the agricultural sector. Which of the following was NOT included in land reforms?
a)  Repealing provisions of tenancy on land
b)  Abolition of intermediaries
c)  Introducing land ceilings
d)  Regulating ownership rights on land
Answer: A
 The land reforms regulated, not repealed, tenancy on farms. For e.g. amount of rent, ownership rights, rights of sharecroppers, rights against eviction were regulated. So, (a) is the answer.
The abolition of intermediaries meant that tenants came into direct contact with the government — they were thus freed from being exploited by the zamindars. So, (b) is correct.
Option (c) means fixing the maximum size of land which could be owned by an individual. The purpose of land ceiling was to reduce the concentration of land ownership in a few hands.
Option (a) and (b) explain option (d).
 The idea behind this move was that ownership of land would give incentives to the tillers to invest in making improvements provided sufficient capital was made available to them known as the policy of 'land to the tiller'
This is because ownership of land enables the tiller to make profit from the increased output. Tenants do not have the incentive to make improvements on land since it is the landowner who would benefit more from higher output.

78 Which of following factor(s) may deter oil exploration in the Arctic sea or make such exploration less attractive for India?
1.  Conflict over Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Arctic between littoral nations
2.  Arctic ecosystem is fragile
3.  Oil extraction in Arctic may lead to release of black carbon and methane.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Many of the boundary lines in the Arctic remain to be fully demarcated as under EEZ. Therefore, disputes can arise on resource extraction in the Arctic.
Statement 2: The short growing season and the low diversity of living organisms make the Arctic ecosystem vulnerable to global warming, climate change, exploratory activities etc.
Statement 3: Oil extraction in Arctic may release black carbon and methane leading to global warming and thawing of Arctic ice. It subsequently causes climate change. Some studies estimate the cost involved as $60 trillion to the world economy.

79 His work Brihadsamhita is a great work in Sanskrit literature. It deals with a variety of subjects like astronomy, astrology, geography, architecture, weather, animals, marriage and omens. He is
a) Varahamihira
b) Brahmagupta
c)  Aryabhatta
d)  Vishnusarma
Answer: A
 The Gupta period witnessed a brilliant activity in the sphere of mathematics, astronomy, astrology and medicine.
Aryabhatta was the first to declare that the earth was spherical in shape and that it rotates on its own axis. However, these views were rejected by later astronomers like Varahamihira and Brahmagupta.
Varahamihira composed Pancha Siddhantika, the five astronomical systems. He was also a great authority on astrology.
His Brihadjataka is considered to be a standard work on astrology.

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Alternative dispute resolution in India is not new and it was in existence even under the previous Arbitration Act, 1940. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was enacted and then the ordinance in
2015. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: Decision reached through arbitration can be binding and need not be approved by the courts. However, the decisions can be challenged in some cases in the courts.

82 Under the SHG-Bank Linkage programme
1.  It is mandatory for all banks to give credit to any registered SHG that approaches the bank for credit.
2.  Loans received under the programme can only be used for income- generation or employment generation activities.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Banks lay down certain eligibility criteria for granting loans to SHGs under the programme. For e.g. ICICI bank criteria are:
SHG should be in existence for at least 6 months
Group of 10-20 women
A minimum Savings/Corpus of Rs 5,000
Acceptable level of financial and administrative discipline in running of the SHG
So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: SHGs use this loan either for Income generation activities/
business expansion or Livelihood activities. So, 2 is wrong.
 The Self-Help Group-Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP), which started as a pilot programme in 1992 has developed with rapid strides over the years.
Under the SBLP, the following three different models have emerged: Model I: SHGs promoted, guided and financed by banks.
Model II: SHGs promoted by NGOs/ Government agencies and
financed by banks.
Model III: SHGs promoted by NGOs and financed by banks using
NGOs/formal agencies as financial intermediaries.
Model II has emerged as the most popular model under the SBLP programme. Commercial banks, co-operative banks and the regional rural banks have been actively participating in the SBLP.

84 How would the Gold monetization scheme help Indian economy?
1.  It will help liquidate unproductive physical asset gold.
2.  It will free up idle gold to Gems and Jewellery industry use.
3.  It will help contain the current account deficit.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 The government's gold monetisation scheme that will allow individuals to park a minimum of 30 grams of the yellow metal with banks and earn tax-free interests will help curb rising gold imports.
Higher gold imports—$56.5 and $53.8 billion in FY12 and FY13, respectively—resulted in record current account deficit of 4.2% and 4.8% of GDP in these two years. So, 3 is correct.
The scheme is intended to bring into circulation a part of the 20,000 tonnes of gold held by households and temple trusts. It will increase recycling of domestically held gold and reduce jewellers' reliance on imported gold. So, 1 and 2 are correct.
The scheme's success will depend on the attractiveness of interest rates offered by banks.

85 The Mahalanobis model of economic growth adopted in post-independent India laid stress on
a)  Development of agriculture as the prime moving sector of the economy
b)  Reliance on heavy industries and import substitution
c)  Developing light industrial base with more focus on consumer goods whose shortage may result in inflation
d)  Development of informal links of the Indian economy with global markets
Answer: B
 At the time of formulation of the 2nd five year plan, Mahalanobis showed that to achieve a rapid long- term rate of growth it would be essential to devote a major part of the investment outlay to building of basic heavy
industries.
The pillars of Nehru - Mahalonobis strategy were - (a) high savings rate, (b) heavy industry bias, (c) protectionist policies and public sector, (d) import substitution, and (e) socialistic pattern of society.
About option (a) and (c): In critique of the Mahalanobis heavy industry development strategy, Professors Vakil and Brahmanand of Bombay University put forward a wage-goods (consumer goods) model of development and suggested a development strategy which accorded a top priority to agriculture and other wage-goods industries in sharp contrast to the Mahalanobis heavy industry biased strategy of development.

86 A microwave oven heats a tomato soup quickly as it
a)  Induces water in the soup to vibrate and produce thermal energy
b)  Surrounds the soup matter with ultrasonic vibrations
c)  Directly heats the dry content of the soup
d)  Uses sound energy as a heating medium
Answer: A
  Actually it induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy. Since water is a polar molecule, the most appropriate option here would be (a).
Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform.
They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared cooking items, such as hot butter, fats, and chocolate. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures.

87 The form of government during the Sangam period in South India was
a)  Hereditary monarchy
b)  Confederated republic
c)  Meritocratic autocracy
d)  Indirect democracy
Answer: A
  Hereditary monarchy was the form of government during the Sangam period. The king had also taken the advice of his minister, court-poet and the imperial court or avai.
Each of the Sangam dynasties had a royal Emblem.
The king was assisted by a large body of officials who were divided into five councils. They were ministers (amaichar), priests (anthanar), military commanders (senapathi), envoys (thuthar) and spies (orrar). The military administration was also efficiently organized during the Sangam Age.

88 During the British rule in India, there was "commercialisation of agriculture". What do you understand by this term?
a)  Peasants were forced to pay higher rents on agricultural produce by the British
b)  Surplus produce was produced by peasants which was to be sold in domestic and international markets
c)  British developed irrigation and extension facilities in agricultural farms by supporting peasants through several incentives
d)  Agriculture became a major source of employment in rural India
Answer: B
 Option (a) refers to the land settlements systems introduced by the British which gave fillip to commercialization of agriculture. It does not describe the term itself.
British helped developed irrigation facilities in few blocks. But this was a consequence of necessity due to the commercialization, and does not describe the term itself. So, option (c) is also incorrect.
Agriculture was already a major source of employment in rural India. Higher cash crop selling rates did attract farmers, who shifted from food crops to
cash crops. Option (d) is thus not relevant here.
 The commercialization of Indian agriculture started post 1813 when the industrial revolution in England gained pace and became prominent around 1860 A.D (during American Civil War which boosted demand of Cotton from India to Britain as America was not able to export Cotton).
It was done primarily to feed the British industries as it was achieved only in cases-of those agricultural products which were either needed by the British industries or could fetch cash commercial gain to the British in the European or American market.
Most of the plantations for commercial crops were controlled by the English. For e.g. jute made products got a ready market in America and Europe. Indigo planters forced commercial contracts on the Bihar peasantry to grow a minimum amount of indigo on their fields.
Under forced commercialization, they gave crops loans and promised to offload the entire produce thus giving farmer a sense of financial security. In reality, the interest rates were high; contract terms deceptive and farmer was remunerated much less than market value of the produce.

89 Before the advent of British rule in India, which of the following handicraft industries existed?
1.  Cotton and silk textiles
2.  Metal
3.  Precious stone works
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  2 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 India had an independent economy before the advent of the British rule. Though agriculture was the main source of livelihood for most people, yet, the country's economy was characterised by various kinds of
manufacturing activities.
India was particularly well known for its handicraft industries in the fields of cotton and silk textiles, metal and precious stone works etc.
These products enjoyed a worldwide market based on the reputation of the fine quality of material used and the high standards of craftsmanship seen in all imports from India, for e.g. Decca Muslin.

90 As per the revenue settlement systems introduced by the British,
a)  The Zamindars were made accountable for the development of agriculture
b)  All land from peasants and zamindars were confiscated by the official treasury
c)  Peasants were made the real land owners of their farm properties and the British their legal protectorates
d)  British made payment of agricultural rent mandatory
Answer: D
 Under the Permanent settlement system, it was thought that if British fix the land rent, and if productivity increases in future, zamindars will have an incentive to invest more in agriculture to earn more later. But,
this was the philosophy behind only the fixed revenue settlement system, and not the most appropriate out of the 4 options here. So, (a) is inappropriate.
Land was only confiscated when payment of rent failed. So, (b) is incorrect. British were the real land owners, and any other party like Zamindars or
Ryots were given nominal rights over the land. Land could be confiscated by
the state as its property. So, (c) is also wrong.

91 Which of the following differentiates between a "trade mark" and a "patent"?
1.  Patent requires registration whereas trade mark does not.
2.  A slogan or catchphrase can be trademarked, but not patented.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Both require registration, else trademark or patent cannot be claimed over the product (phrase, logo etc.). So, 1 is incorrect.
Protecting a title, slogan, or other short word phrase, generally requires trademark, not Patent. So, 2 is correct.
 A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor issued by the government. It is the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling. Thus, it is more restrictive than both copyrights and trademark.
In trademark the same good can be made. However, it does not restrict others from innovating in the patented subject-matter, as also in the case of copyrights (where the subject matter can be written upon by others too).

92 Consider the following about the social life during the Gupta period.
1.  The practice of untouchability was abolished during this period.
2.  Women were prohibited from studying the religious texts like the Puranas.
3.  Most of the Gupta kings encouraged Brahamanism.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
  Statement 1: The Brahmins occupied the top ladder of the society. The practice of untouchability had slowly begun during
this period. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: The position of women had also become miserable during the Gupta period. They were prohibited from studying the religious texts like the Puranas. The subjection of women to men was thoroughly regularized. But it was insisted that they should be protected and generously treated by men. So,
2 is correct.
Statements 3: In the sphere of religion, Brahmanism reigned supreme during the Gupta period. It had two branches - Vaishnavism and Saivism. Most of the Gupta kings were Vaishnavaites. They performed Aswamedha sacrifices. So, 3 is correct.

93 What is the recommendation of the Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC)
regarding the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003?
a)  Replace existing FRBM Act with a Debt ceiling and Fiscal Responsibility Law
b)  Relax the debt limits in the FRBM Act for both Central as well as state governments
c)  Add financial punitive measures in the FRBM Act for not adhering to the FRBM debt limits
d)  The fiscal and revenue deficit targets from FRBM Act should be increased
Answer: A
 Some of the key recommendations:
Set up an independent council to undertake assessment of fiscal policy implications of Budget proposals
Replace existing FRBM Act with a debt ceiling & fiscal responsibility law
Wind up National Investment Fund and maintain all disinvestment receipts in the consolidated fund
Amend electricity Act to provide for penalties for delay in payment of subsidies by state governments
Submission of states on minimum guaranteed devolution turned down Steps for states to augment revenues, such as property tax reforms and issuance of municipal bonds suggested
Set up autonomous and independent GST compensation fund

94 Which of the following literary source give information regarding the history of the Mauryas?
1.  Rabatak inscription
2.  Kautilya's Arthasastra
3.  Visakadatta's Mudrarakshasa
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
 Statement 1: It is about Kushan Empire. So, 1 can't be the answer.
Statement 2: This book in Sanskrit was written by Kautilya, a contemporary of Chandragupta Maurya. It is the most important literary source for the history of the Mauryas.
Statement 3: The Mudrarakshasa written by Visakadatta is a drama in Sanskrit. Although written during the Gupta period, it describes how Chandragupta with the assistance of Kautilya overthrew the Nandas. It also gives a picture on the socio-economic condition under the Mauryas.

95 Which of the following bacterium may be used for bio-remediation operations?
1.  Pseudomonas
2.  Mycobacterium
3.  Nitrosomonas
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Fast development of molecular microbiological tool has enabled the identification of many un-culturable microbes and therefore extended the list of microbial species with petroleum hydrocarbon degrading abilities.
Species of Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Haemophilus, Rhodococcus, Paenibacillus and Ralstonia, are some of the most extensively studied bacteria for their bioremediation capability.

96 Consider the following about the provincial and Local Administration in the
Mauryan empire.
1.  The provincial governors were appointed based only on merit.
2.  There was no system of Municipal administration.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: The provincial governors were mostly appointed from the members of royal family. So, 1 would be wrong. They were responsible the maintenance of law and order and collection of taxes for the empire.
Statement 2: Both Kautilya and Megasthanes provided the system of Municipal administration. Arthasastra contains a full chapter on the role of Nagarika or city superintendent. His chief duty was to maintain law and order. So, 2 would be wrong.
 The district administration was under the charge of Rajukas, whose position and functions are similar to modern collectors.
He was assisted by Yuktas or subordinate officials.
Village administration was in the hands of Gramani and his official superior was called Gopa who was in charge of ten or fifteen villages.

97 A microbial fuel cell can generate energy using
1.  Electrochemically active bacteria
2.  Bacterial decomposition of organic compounds in water
3.  Photosynthetic activity of microorganisms
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 A microbial fuel cell is a device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy by the catalytic reaction of microorganisms.
A typical microbial fuel cell consists of anode and cathode compartments separated by a cation (positively charged ion) specific membrane. In the anode compartment, fuel is oxidized by microorganisms, generating CO2, electrons and protons.
Electrons are transferred to the cathode compartment through an external electric circuit, while protons are transferred to the cathode compartment through the membrane.
Statement 1: Some MFCs use electrochemically active bacteria to transfer electrons to the electrode (electrons are carried directly from the bacterial respiratory enzyme to the electrode).
Statement 2: Some MFC's produce electric current by the bacterial decomposition of organic compounds in water. But, there are microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) also which reverse this process to generate hydrogen or methane by applying a voltage to bacteria.
Statement 3: Phototrophic biofilm MFCs (PBMFCs) are the ones that make use photosynthetic microorganism like chlorophyta, cyanophyta etc., since they could carry out photosynthesis and thus they act as both producers of organic metabolites and also as electron donors

98 A closed economy is likely to have which of the following characteristics?
a)  Fiscal deficit would be zero.
b)  The central bank does not control money supply.
c)  The government does not have a right to print currency.
d)  Balance of Payments is zero.
Answer: D
 A closed economy is self-sufficient, meaning that no imports are brought in and no exports are sent out. The goal is to provide consumers with everything that they need from within the economy's borders. A closed economy is the opposite of an open economy, in which a country will conduct trade with outside regions.
So, if no capital or goods/services are imported, exported, the BoP will be zero, and (d) will be correct.
In this case, the fiscal deficit need not be zero since a developing country may adopt expansionary fiscal policy to tackle poverty and unemployment. So, (a) would be wrong.

99 Upwelling which occurs in the open ocean and along coastlines brings nutrients rich deep water to the surface. Upwelling is caused due to
a)  Local surface winds
b)  Growth of coral reefs at ocean bed
c)  Artificial discharge of iron in ocean
d)  Ocean bottom-dwelling organisms
Answer: A
 Winds blowing across the ocean surface push water away. Water then rises up from beneath the surface to replace the water that was pushed away. This process is known as "upwelling."
Upwelling occurs in the open ocean and along coastlines. The reverse
process, called "downwelling," also occurs when wind causes surface water to build up along a coastline and the surface water eventually sinks toward the bottom.
Water that rises to the surface as a result of upwelling is typically colder and is rich in nutrients. These nutrients "fertilize" surface waters, meaning that these surface waters often have high biological productivity. Therefore, good fishing grounds typically are found where upwelling is common.

100 Consider the following about the "Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear installations" between India and Pakistan.
1.  It bars both countries from attacking each other in case of a perceived war or in any other circumstances.
2.  Both countries exchange the list of their nuclear installations and facilities.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Statement 1: It only bars them from carrying out any surprise attack (or to assist foreign power to attack) on each other's nuclear installations and facilities. It is a not a general agreement on war. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: Under it both countries inform each other about their nuclear installations and facilities that need to be covered under the Agreement on 1
January every year.
It was signed In 1988 and entered into force in 1991. It was signed by then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his Pakistani counterpart Benazir Bhutto.
