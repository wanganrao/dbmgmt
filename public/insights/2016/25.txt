1 According to IPCC Fifth Assessment Report there is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s which may cause permafrost to thaw. How will the thawing of permafrost affect the earth and atmosphere?
1.  It can exacerbate global warming by releasing methane and other hydrocarbons that are powerful greenhouse gases
2.  It can promote land erosion in mountainous regions even leading to slope failures
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: World-wide, permafrost contains 1700 billion tons of organic material equaling almost half of all organic material in all soils. This pool was built up over thousands of years and is only slowly degraded under the cold conditions in the Arctic.
Permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.
An analogy is when a freezer door is left open, although the ice in the freezer may change phase to a liquid, the food solids will not experience a phase change.
Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as submarine clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming
Statement 2: Over the past century, an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded
It is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing, which is thought to be linked to climate change.
In mountain ranges, much of the structural stability can be attributed to glaciers and permafrost.
As climate warms, permafrost thaws, which results in a less stable mountain
structure, and ultimately more slope failures.

2 Consider the following about Vijaynagar empire.
1.  Religion and Kingdom related affairs were completely separated in the empire
2.  The rulers adopted the title of "Hindu suratranas".
3.  All royal orders were signed in Sanskrit
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: B
 Statement 1 and 2: Religion and religious classes had a vital role in the political, social and economic life of the Vijaynagar empire.
The principle of strict adherence to dharma was the chief constituent and distinguishing feature of the Vijaynagar state
The kings claimed to be the representatives of a specific god and often encouraged temple building as a means of associating themselves with the divine
The very choice of the site of Vijaynagar as the capital city was perhaps inspired by the existence of the shrines of Virupaksha and Pampadevi. The Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of the god Virupaksha.
Rulers also indicated their close links with the godsby using the title "Hindu
Suratrana" this meant Hindu Sultan.
Statement 3: All royal orders were signed "Shri Virupaksha", usually in the Kannada script

3 The Indian Railways (IR) has recently embarked on a strategy to migrate from existing arrangements with many state power distribution utilities to procure electricity through open access. Open access will help railways to
a)  Cut power costs
b)  Increase the speed of trains
c)  Electrify the railway tracks
d)  Make power access safer for the running trains
Answer: A
 The Indian Railways (IR), one of the largest transportation networks in the world, consumes 17.5 billion units of energy (1.7 per cent of the country's total electricity consumption) for which it pays about R12,300 crore to distribution companies annually.
This amounts to more than 25 per cent of total revenue budget of IR which is the second largest component of its revenue expenditure
The Open Access policy under the Electricity Act, 2003, allows consumers with electricity load above 1 mw to procure power directly from markets.
If railways procures power through open access (which is cheaper), it can reduce power costs substantially by paying progressive power tarrifs for different trains and tracks. This will help subsidize train fares running in relatively backward regions

Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  1 and 4 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
 Statement 1: The Indian nuclear 
development.
Nations already signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) saw the need to further limit the export of nuclear equipment, materials or technology and thus established NSG
Statement 2: Listed items can be exported to non-nuclear states if certain International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards were agreed to or if exceptional circumstances relating to safety existed. For e.g. India waiver based on US-India Civil Nuclear Deal.
Statement 3: If China blocks India's entry to NSG, India will not be able to join it despite the support of all other members
Statement 4: It functions as an independent group from IAEA, but uses the services of IAEA.

Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Statement 1: There is no model code of conduct for the RS election as the nature of the election is different. There are no public meetings, rallies, door-to- door canvassing or media campaigns
The constituency is confined to a small electoral college consisting of MLAs. The voting is open so the party MLAs are subject to party discipline.
Statement 2: Experts have recommended that anti-defection provisions should apply in case of RS elections
Statement 3: On a complaint brought by three senior political leaders about rampant horse-trading among MLAs, the EC countermanded the RS poll in Jharkhand in
2012. So, 3 is wrong.

14 No one can be compelled to sing the National Anthem because
1.  It will be against the Right to freedom of speech and expression.
2.  There is no legal provision that obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 In 1987, a two-judge Bench of the SC ordered a school in Kerala to take back three children who had been expelled for not singing the National Anthem, although they stood during the Anthem
The children desisted from singing because of their conviction that their religion did not permit them to join any rituals except in their prayers to Jehovah, their God.
The court ruled that there is no legal provision that obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem, and it is not disrespectful to the Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when it is being sung does not join in the singing
The court, however, did not deal with the issue of whether it would be disrespectful if a person chose not to stand during the National Anthem. The judgment ended with the message: "Our tradition teaches tolerance; our philosophy preaches tolerance; our Constitution practises tolerance; let us not dilute it."

b)  Tax exemptions given to local manufacturing units for export of solar-power equipments
c)  Cap on FDI limits in the solar cell manufacturing sector
d)  Government encouraging sourcing of solar-power related equipments from domestic manufacturers
Answer: D
 India lost this case against the United States as the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that domestic content requirements (DCR) in India's solar power development programme conflict with international rules of imports
The US trade complaint in 2013 alleged that the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission subsidies were available only if developers used equipment produced in India
National treatment of any investment whether domestic or foreign is a key
WTO principle, thus violating a key global trade rule
The government had offered financial support of up to Rs.1 crore per MW to the implementing agency for setting up large solar capacities by placing orders with domestic manufacturers. It also had domestic content deployment requirements for a certain part of government's solar power requirements.

16 Ripon's resolution of 1882 was a landmark official statement in British India. It is related to
a)  Development of local self-government in India
b)  Spread of vernacular education in India via western methods
c)  Judicial and police reforms
d)  Women Empowerment and child rights
Answer: A
 The development of local self government in India owes their progress to the sincere efforts of Lord Ripon in this direction. His most significant contribution was in the field of local self-Government.
He passed a resolution in 1881 which clearly stated that the time had come when further steps could be taken to develop the system of Local self- Government
The said resolution directed the provincial Government to transfer considerable revenue to local bodies that were to deal with matters of local importance. The next step in this direction was taken by him when he passed the famous Resolution of 1882
It was made quite clear in this resolution that the expansion of the system of
local self-Government was not to improve the efficiency of the
administration. It is chiefly desirable as an instrument of political and popular education.

21 "Fracking technology" that occurs frequently in news is related to
a)  Genetic Engineering
b)  Extraction and production of Shale gas
c)  Nuclear Reactors
d)  Cyber Security
Answer: B
 Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking", is the process of drilling and injecting fluid into the ground at a high pressure in order to fracture shale rocks to release natural gas inside.
It takes 1-8 million gallons of water to complete each fracturing job.
Up to 600 chemicals are used in fracking fluid, including known carcinogens and toxins.
The mixture reaches the end of the well where the high pressure causes the nearby shale rock to crack, creating fissures where natural gas flows into the well.
During this process, methane gas and toxic chemicals leach out from the system and contaminate nearby groundwater
Methane concentrations are higher in drinking-water wells near fracturing sites than in normal wells

Ramsar Sites are designated because they meet the Criteria for identifying
Wetlands of International Importance
The first criterion refers to Sites containing representative, rare or unique
wetland types, and the other eight cover Sites of international importance for conserving biological diversity.
These criteria emphasize the importance the Convention places on sustaining biodiversity

The peasants (bhumihars) of the Champaran and other areas of North Bihar were growing the Indigo under the tinakathia system.
he price was too less and was fixed on the area cultivated rather than the crop produced. They were actually being cheated by the English planters.
Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha were the events which later put Gandhi on the front seat of Indian National Revolution and made Satyagraha a powerful tool

29 Blue carbon is the carbon
a)  Fixed by terrestrial organisms
b)  Stored in deep soil covers
c)  Captured by World's oceans and coastal ecosystems
d)  Found in limestone dominated regions
Answer: C
 The carbon captured by living organisms in oceans is stored in the form of biomass and sediments from mangroves, salt marshes, seagrasses and potentially
algae
Although the ocean's vegetated habitats cover less than 0.5% of the seabed, they are responsible for more than 50%, and potentially up to 70%, of all carbon storage in ocean sediments.
Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses make up the majority of the ocean's vegetated habitats but only equal 0.05% of the plant biomass on land.
One of the main concerns with Blue Carbon is the rate of loss of these important marine ecosystems is much higher than any other ecosystem on the planet, even compared to rainforests

b)  Generic medicines cannot be exported
c)  It allows a patented innovation to be used by non-patent holders in public interest.
d)  It allows consumers to demand cheap drugs that have been obtained as a

Answer: C
 CL is the grant of permission by the government to entities to use, manufacture, import or sell a patented invention without the patent-owner's consent
CL is permitted under the WTO's TRIPS (IPR) Agreement provided conditions such as 'national emergencies, other circumstances of extreme urgency and anticompetitive practices' are fulfilled.
So far, India has issued only one CL for an anti-cancer medicine Nexavar
Permitting compulsory licensing does not mean confiscating the patented
technology but effecting technology transfer by paying the patent holders reasonable royalties

37 The amount of solar energy received at various parts of earth varies according to latitude because of the
a)  Bulge at equator and poles
b)  Dominance of water bodies
c)  Curvature of earth
d)  Both (a) and (c)
Answer: C
 The earth is pear-shaped, however its shape has a bearing on the gravitation forces more, rather than changing the amount of solar energy received at various latitudes.
If the earth was vertically flat and not tilted, all places would have received the same solar energy.
Dominance of water bodies affects how the solar energy received is distributed, it does not change the amount of energy received per se (barring glaciers that reflect sunlight).

79 Climate change can be caused by
1.  Variations in solar radiation received by Earth
2.  Volcanic eruptions
3.  Plate tectonics
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: The rate at which energy is received from the Sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of Earth.
This energy is distributed around the globe by winds, ocean currents, and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions.
Statement 2: The eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the Earth's climate on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100,000 tons of SO2 into the stratosphere.
This is due to the optical properties of SO2 and sulfate aerosols, which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation, creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze blocking sun radiation.
Statement 3: The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate.
A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream.

The emoluments and allowances of the Governor and other expenditure relating to his office;
The salaries and allowances of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and, in the case of a State having a Legislative Council, also of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council.
However please note that the retired Judges are entitled to a pension which is drawn from consolidated fund of India.

It also sets parameters on a nuclear operator's financial liability, time limits governing possible legal action, requires that nuclear operators maintain
insurance or other financial security measures and provides for a single competent court to hear claims.
It thus addresses the concerns of foreign nuclear equipment suppliers. International nuclear reactor makers have been reluctant to set up plants in India because of the 2010 domestic Civil Nuclear Liability Law - that makes equipment suppliers accountable for accidents and not the plant operators, as is the global norm.
This will help spur the growth of nuclear energy in India.

98 Which of the following is/are indicators of climate change on earth?
1.  Shrinking of glacier and Sea level change
2.  Temperature measurements of earth
3.  Cloud cover and precipitation
4.  Change in the type, distribution and coverage of vegetation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
Statement 1 and 2: As temperatures warm, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt; the converse is also true; causing sea level to rise. Sea level also rises due to global warming, which is another indicator of climate change.
Statement 3: Climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation.
Statement 4: Some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth, resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne CO2. A gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times, driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms.

99 The Amar-nayaka system was a salient feature of the political organisation of
Vijaynagar. Amara nayaka was a
a)  Military officer who had a specified number of troops under his control
b)  Independent manager of the royal treasury
c)  Judge appointed by the royal court in the villages to settle disputes independently of the empire
d)  Property owner who was given in a stake in the Kingdom's assets and
governance
Answer: A
 In the opinion of some historians there is every likelihood that several features of this system had been derived from the lqta system of the Delhi Sultanate.
Amara nayaka was a military officer or chief who had a specified number of troops under his control. These nayakas possessed revenue-rights over land or territory known as amaram (amara-makara or amaramaha).
The area of land thus alienated under the tenure was about 3/4 in the Tamil country and also in the Vijaynagar empire.
They collected taxes and other dues from peasants, crallspersons and traders. A part of the revenue was retained by them for their personal use and for maintaining a stipulated contingent of horses and elephants.
Giving gills to temples, repair and building of tanks, reclamation of
wasteland etc. were the main obligations and activities of the amaranayakas.
