1 How will the "Kaladan Multimodal Project" be useful to India and Myanmar?
1.  It will provide seamless transport and transit rights to the northeastern states through
Bangladesh for both nations.
2.  It will reduce the need to transport goods through the narrow Siliguri corridor.
3.  It will reduce sea route distance between India and Myanmar.
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
  It will connect the eastern Indian seaport of Kolkata with Sittwe seaport in Myanmar by sea; it will then link Sittwe seaport to Paletwa in Myanmar via Kaladan river boat route and then from Paletwa on to Mizoram by
road transport.
This project will reduce distance from Kolkata to Sittwee by approximately 1328 km and will reduce the need to transport good through the narrow Siliguri corridor, also known as Chicken's Neck. So, both 2 and 3 are correct.
Initially India had tried to persuade Bangladesh to offer transport and transit rights to the northeastern states.
However, Bangladesh has consistently refused to grant such rights, including access to its Chittagong port, which is less than 200 km away from Agartala, the capital of Tripura. So, 1 is incorrect.

2.  Water exists on earth and it doesn't exist on them or their atmosphere in any state.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
Statement 1: Olympus Mons is a shield volcano on Mars and it is the largest volcano in the Solar System.
Olympus Mons measures an incredible 27 km in height and is 3 times taller than
Mount Everest. It is about 500 km in diameter.
The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanic features and has more volcanoes than any other planet in the Solar System. Mercury is quiter as compared to these two planets, but volcanoes do exist on it.
Statement 2: In late 2012, MESSENGER confirmed the discovery of ice in
User Name :      Kant
permanently shadowed craters near Mercury planet's north pole.
Astronomers have detected that the atmosphere of Venus consists of 0.002%
water vapor. Water vapour exists on Mars too.
But, there isn't any water on the surface of Venus, in form of rivers, lakes or oceans.
New findings from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provide the strongest evidence yet that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars.

3 Gandhi was not in favour of the socialism propounded by Nehru, which emphasized on large-scale production. Why?
a)  He believed that mass production would again lead to enslavement of India by foreigners.
b)  He believed that post-independent India did not have the resources to go for large-scale production
c)  He did not see the basic necessities of life being fulfilled by mass production.
d)  He feared that mass production would lead to greater exploitation of class by
class and urbanization
Answer: D
Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres.
In order to achieve this means he advocated trusteeship, decentralization of economic activities, labour-intensive technology and priority to weaker sections.
The revival of the economy is made possible only when it is free from exploitation, so according to Gandhi, industrialization on a mass-scale will lead to passive or active exploitation of the people as the problem of competition and marketing comes in.
Gandhi believes that for an economy to be self-contained, it should
manufacture mainly for its use even if that necessitates the use of modern

machines and tools, provided it is not used as a means of exploitation of others.

6 Spacecraft travelling beyond low Earth orbit leave the protection of earth's geomagnetic field and transit the Van Allen belts. What implications do the Van Allen belt has for space travel?
1.  Solar cells and sensors can be damaged by radiation in the belt.
2.  Any liquid carried in the spacecraft will be magnetized causing a hazard to the spacecraft.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Statement 1 and 2: Beyond the low earth orbit, spacecrafts face additional hazards from cosmic rays and solar flares.
User Name :      Kant
A region between the inner and outer Van Allen belts lies at two to four Earth radii and is sometimes referred to as the "safe zone".
Solar cells, integrated circuits, and sensors can be damaged by radiation. Geomagnetic storms occasionally damage electronic components on spacecraft.
Electronics on satellites must be hardened against radiation to operate reliably.
The Hubble Space Telescope, among other satellites, often has its sensors turned off when passing through regions of intense radiation.
The magnetic field in and around Van Allen raditiaon belts is not strong enough to magnetize water to the extent that it can damage the spacecraft.

8 Which of the following is disadvantageous to developing countries' international trade?
User Name :      Kant
a)  Protection to domestic industries from dumping
b)  Free trade with other developing nations
c)  Exports of primary articles and import of manufactured goods
d)  Establishing regional trading blocs
Answer: C
The present integration of global markets favours the more competitive product from a more competitive country.
Developed countries have an edge over manufactured goods due to advance in physical as well as human capital, and are thus preferred to import goods from.
Developing countries are preferred for exporting primary articles because they have an abundance of it.
This affects their competitiveness in the long-run as they miss out on the chance to build a manufacturing base, and remain a primary producer backward economy.

9 Earthquakes occur at
1.  Divergent plate boundaries.
2.  Ocean-ocean convergent plate boundaries.
3.  Ocean-continent plate boundaries.
4.  Transform boundaries.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 3 and 4 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries where the plates meet. In fact, the locations of earthquakes and the kinds of ruptures they produce help
scientists define the plate boundaries.
User Name :      Kant
There are three types of plate boundaries: spreading zones, transform faults, and subduction zones.
At spreading zones, molten rock rises, pushing two plates apart and adding new material at their edges.
Statement 1: Divergent boundaries are those at which crustal plates move away from each other, such as at mid-oceanic ridge.
The formation of new ocean crust that is pushed away from both sides of the ridge fault creates a tensional setting that results in the formation of the graben.
Earthquakes are located along the normal faults that form the sides of the rift or beneath the floor of the rift.
Statement 4: Transform faults are found where plates slide past one another. Shallow-focus earthquakes occur along transform boundaries where two plates move past each other.

23 Bardoli Satyagraha (1928) was launched because
a)  The government refused to revise taxes despite floods and famine
b)  The big landlords of Bardoli had supported the British to usurp all farm land belonging to the ryots
c)  The British extended irrigation facilities to all nearby villages except Bardoli without any rational basis
d)  The government confiscated all crop produce of a farm land
Answer: A
In 1925, the taluka of Bardoli in Gujarat suffered from floods and famine, causing crop production to suffer and leaving farmers facing great financial troubles.
However, the government of the Bombay Presidency had raised the tax rate by 30% that year, and despite petitions from civic groups, refused to cancel the rise in the face of the calamities.
In 1928, an agreement was finally brokered by a Parsi member of the
Bombay government. The Government agreed to restore the confiscated
lands and properties, as well as cancel revenue payment not only for the year, but cancel the 30% raise until after the succeeding year.
The movement was eventually led by Vallabhbhai Patel, and its success gave rise to Patel becoming one of the main leaders of the independence movement.

24 "Pareto optimality" is a situation where
a)  Resources are allocated in a way in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off
b)  Resources are allocated in the most socially desirable way
c)  Resource are allocated as per democratic means based on the principles of equity and fairness
d)  All of the above apply
Answer: A
  The situation in option (a) may not be socially desirable.
For e.g. we may take away Rs. 10,000 from a billionaire and give it to a BPL family;
it would hardly make a difference to the welfare of the rich but would matter a lot for the BPL family.
So, while this transfer of Rs. 10,000 is socially desirable, it would not be considered pareto optimum, nor it it done based on democratic means.
The concept is purely based on the idea that greater economic efficiency leads to more economic welfare, which as we just verified, may not be correct.

28 Karst topography is the result of
a)  Soil erosion
b)  Biological weathering of silicate rock
c)  Chemical weathering of carbonate rock
d)  Spheroidal weathering
Answer: C
User Name :      Kant
Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves.
The development of karst occurs whenever acidic water starts to break down the surface of bedrock near its cracks, or bedding planes.
As the bedrock (like limestone or dolostone) continues to break down, its cracks tend to get bigger.
As time goes on, these fractures will become wider, and eventually, a drainage system of some sort may start to form underneath.

a)  Basalt is related to granite.
b)  Slate is related to shale.
c)  Gravel is related to siltstone.
d)  Gneiss is related to marble.
Answer: B
 When a metamorphic rock is formed under pressure, its crystals become arranged in layers.
Slate, which is formed from shale, is like this.
Slate is useful for making roof tiles because its layers can be split into separate flat sheets.
Metamorphic rocks sometimes contain fossils if they were formed from a sedimentary rock, but the fossils are usually squashed out of shape.

38 The presence of even a small patch of vegetation can reduce noise levels considerably. How do plants reduce noise?
1.  Sound absorption
User Name :      Kant
2.  Sound deflection
3.  Sound refraction
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Plant parts such as stems, leaves, branches, wood, etc. absorb sound. The greater number of plants, the size of the plant and the surface area of the plant will all affect its ability to absorb sound.
Statement 2: When sound hits something solid, it does not vibrate (because it is rigid). Sound waves are reflected off the it and back toward the source.
Statement 3: Sound waves can also be refracted. A good example of this is carpeting in a home that reduces the echoes.
Plantings that cover surface areas help accomplish the same feat. For example, vines on walls and the sides of buildings will help refract sound. Lawns, ground cover plantings and green walls are excellent at refracting sound.

d)  Exit problems for companies in India
Answer: D
 The Charkravyuha legend from the Mahabharata describes the ability to enter but not exit, with seriously adverse consequences.
User Name :      Kant
A market economy requires unrestricted entry of new firms, new ideas, and new technologies so that the forces of competition can guide capital and labour resources to their most productive and dynamic uses.
But it also requires exit so that resources are forced or enticed away from inefficient and unsustainable uses.
However, over the course of six decades, the Indian economy moved from
'socialism with limited entry to "marketism" without exit'. The chapter 2 addresses these in detail.

43 Weathering causes the disintegration of rock near the surface of the earth. Which of the following may cause weathering?
1.  Repeated temperature changes
2.  Frost action
3.  Penetration of rocks by plant roots
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Statement 1: Thermal stress weathering results from the expansion and contraction of rock, caused by temperature changes.
For example, heating of rocks by sunlight or fires can cause expansion of their constituent minerals.
As some minerals expand more than others, temperature changes set up differential stresses that eventually cause the rock to crack apart.
Statement 2: Water seeps into cracks and crevices in rock. If the temperature drops low enough, the water will freeze. When water freezes, it expands.
The ice then works as a wedge. It slowly widens the cracks and splits the rock.
User Name :      Kant
When ice melts, water performs the act of erosion by carrying away the tiny rock fragments lost in the split.
Statement 3: Plants and animals are agents of mechanical weathering. The seed of a tree may sprout in soil that has collected in a cracked rock.
As the roots grow, they widen the cracks, eventually breaking the rock into pieces. Over time, trees can break apart even large rocks. Even small plants, such as mosses, can enlarge tiny cracks as they grow.

46 The Government of India is introducing Injectable Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into its routine Immunization program along with oral polio vaccine (OPV) as part of India's commitment to the "Global Polio Endgame Strategy". Why IPV is introduced despite the existence of OPV?
1.  As IPV is not a 'live' vaccine, it carries no risk of vaccine- associated polio paralysis unlike OPV.
2.  IPV is much cheaper than OPV.
3.  IPV can stop transmission of the virus in case of a polio outbreak which OPV is incapable to.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
User Name :      Kant
d)  1 and 2 only
Answer: A
Statement 1 and 2: There are two types of polio vaccine in use: the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).
Advantages of OPV compared with IPV are ease of administration (does not need a trained health worker) and the lower cost. The advantage of IPV is that it is not a "live" vaccine (i.e. it is inactivated) and thus carries no risk of vaccine-associated paralysis.
Statement 3: An increasing number of industrialized, polio-free countries are using
IPV as the vaccine of choice.
However, as IPV does not stop transmission of the virus, oral polio vaccine is used wherever a polio outbreak needs to be contained, even in countries which rely exclusively on IPV for their routine immunization programme (e.g. the polio outbreak in the Netherlands in 1992).
IPV is not recommended for routine use in polio-endemic countries or in developing countries at risk of poliovirus importations.

47 Consider the following statements.Assertion (a): Volcanoes are not likely to be found in the regions of earthquake.Reason (R): Earthquakes are induced by seismic activity; volcanoes do not require seismic activity.In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: D
 The world's distribution of earthquaks coincides very closely with that of volcanoes. Regions of great seismicity such as circum pacific ring of fire are
also regions of major volcanic eruptions.
User Name :      Kant
Many processes in and around volcanoes can generate earthquakes. Most of the time, these processes are faulting and fracturing that does not lead to an eruption.
However, volcanic earthquakes do occur as magma and volcanic gases rise to the surface from depth, which involves significant stress changes in the crust as the material migrates upward.
Also, earthquake activity beneath a volcano almost always increases before an eruption because magma and volcanic gas must first force their way up through shallow underground fractures and passageways.
When magma and volcanic gases or fluids move, they will either cause rocks to break or cracks to vibrate.
So, both statements are incorrect.

User Name :      Kant
a)  Breath Control
b)  Dancing
c)  Contemplation
d)  All could have been recommended.
Answer: D
 Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way.
They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir.
Thus emerged the silsilas, a genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice

b)  Negotiating with the princes to bring good governance in the states
c)  First of exhortation for a responsible government in the states and later active political intervention
d)  The INC always treated princely states as an agent of British government and
maintained a distance with them on national affairs
Answer: C
The Congress, for the first time at its Nagpur Session in 1920, enunciated its policy towards the peoples' movement in the Princely States. It called upon the Princes to
grant full responsible government in their States. However, no direct political activity was to be resorted for.
This position continued till 1935.
Two developments in the mid-30s brought a radical change in the relations between the Princely States and British India. The Government of India Act of 1935 projected a scheme of federation in which the States were brought into a direct constitutional relationship with British India.
The second major impact on the States was created by the acceptance of office by the Congress in majority of the British Indian provinces in 1937. The installation of the Congress ministries in the neighbouring British Indian provinces encouraged the Praja Mandal leaders to step up their political
activities for demanding responsible government in the Princely States.

65 The primary source of Earth's heat is a combination of
a)  Extraterrestrial impacts, gravitational energy, radioactivity
b)  Nuclear fusion, volcanism, compression
c)  Compression, volcanism, solar wind
d)  Solar wind, radioactivity, gravitational energy
Answer: A
 There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth:
Heat from when the planet formed and accreted, which has not yet been lost Frictional heating, caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet caused due to gravitation
Heat from the decay of radioactive elements.
It takes a rather long time for heat to move out of the earth.
As a result, much of the planet's primordial heat, from when the earth first accreted and developed its core, has been retained.

68 Why the southern slopes in Himalayan region are covered with thick vegetation cover as compared to sparse vegetation in the northern slopes of the same hills?
1.  Northern region is a rain shadow region and receives lesser precipitation.
2.  Temperature is lower in the Northern region.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
User Name :      Kant
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
The southern slopes of the entire Himalayan Range get plenty of rainfall brought by the moisture laden winds of the south-west monsoon.
Also, the monsoon winds proceeding towards the north eastern parts of India are blocked and deflected towards the west side by the Himalayas.
These winds bring heavy rain and many rivers descend along these slopes bringing plenty water to the plains at the bottom of the mountain range resulting in thick vegetation.
The northern side falls in the rain shadow region, and due to its higher altitude as compared to the Southern part, little vegetation can be found here.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: A
 This happened due to the "iron catastrophe". It was perhaps one of the most significant events in Earth history and occurred when the temperature of the planet reached, and passed, the melting point of iron (1538°C).
When the melting point was reached, droplets of liquid iron, one of Earth's most abundant elements (about 35% overall) flowed (slowly at first) toward the planet interior under the pull of gravity.
Compounds of lighter elements rich in silicon (Si), oxygen (O), and other light elements that were also molten (i.e., Al, Na, Ca, K) were displaced toward the surface.

71 Tropical cyclones dissipate on reaching the land. Why?
a)  On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off.
b)  Friction of moisture laden winds with the ground dissipates the storm.
c)  Coriolis force that drives the cyclone ceases to operate on land.
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans.
The energy that intensifies the storm comes from the condensation process in the towering cumulonimbus clouds, surrounding the centre of the storm.
With continuous supply of moisture from the sea, the storm is further strengthened. On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates.

73 An oligotrophic lake is a lake with
a)  Low primary productivity resulting from low nutrient content
b)  High biological productivity due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus
c)  Biological Productivity caused due to foreign material
d)  No dissolved oxygen resulting in death of plantations and aquatic life
Answer: A
 These lakes have low algal production, and consequently, often have
very clear waters, with high drinking-water quality. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have ample oxygen; thus, such lakes often support many fish species, like lake trout, which require cold, well-oxygenated waters.
The quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other biologically useful nutrients are the primary determinants of a body of water's trophic state index (TSI).
High productivity lakes are called Eutrophic lakes. The image below shows a oligotrophic lake.

2.  Reason (R): Corona discharge in ESPs produces ozone.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
User Name :      Kant
Answer: A
  ESP is a filtration device that removes fine particles, like dust and smoke, from a flowing gas using the force of an induced electrostatic
charge minimally impeding the flow of gases through the unit.
In contrast to wet scrubbers which apply energy directly to the flowing fluid medium, an ESP applies energy only to the particulate matter being collected and therefore is very efficient in its consumption of energy
A negative side-effect of electrostatic precipitation devices is the potential production of toxic ozone and NOx.
Ozone generation is one of the most important limitations in the design of an efficient electrostatic precipitator for use in air-conditioning systems.

77 Metamorphic rocks are formed by increased
a)  Pressure and cementation.
b)  Heat and melting
c)  Pressure and heat
d)  Cooling and solidification
Answer: C
 Earth movements can cause rocks to be deeply buried or squeezed.
As a result, the rocks are heated and put under great pressure. They do not melt, but the minerals they contain are changed chemically,forming metamorphic rocks.
Sometimes, metamorphic rocks are formed when rocks are close to some molten magma, and so get heated up.
When a metamorphic rock is formed under pressure, its crystals become arranged in layers.

78 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): Sound passes through hot air faster than it passes through cold air.
2.  Reason (R): Cold air is denser than hot air.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
  The speed of sound is affected by temperature and humidity. Because it is less dense, sound passes through hot air faster than it passes through cold air.
Also, as sound propagates through air, the air absorbs energy from the sound wave, attenuating (weakening) it.
The attenuation of sound in air is affected by the relative humidity. Dry air absorbs far more acoustical energy than does moist air. This is because moist air is less dense than dry air (water vapor weighs less than air).

a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: B
 Unlike many other biogeochemical cycles, the atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movement of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus-based compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature
and pressure found on Earth. So, R is correct.
User Name :      Kant
Phosphates move quickly through plants and animals; however, the processes that move them through the soil or ocean are very slow, making the phosphorus cycle overall one of the slowest biogeochemical cycles.
Initially, phosphate weathers from rocks and minerals, the most common mineral being apatite.
Overall small losses occur in terrestrial environments by leaching and erosion, through the action of rain.
In soil, phosphate is absorbed on iron oxides, aluminium hydroxides, clay surfaces, and organic matter particles, and becomes incorporated (immobilized or fixed). Plants and fungi can also be active in making P soluble.

a)  Molten rock
b)  Ice and mineral grains
c)  Gas and ice
d)  Rock and a thin atmosphere of water

 They are composed of rock, dust, ice and frozen gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia.
Comets orbit the Sun, just as planets do, except a comet usually has a very elongated orbit. Part of its orbit is very, very far from the Sun and part is quite close to the
Sun.
A comet's nucleus is like a dirty snowball made of ice. As the comet gets

closer to the Sun, some of the ice starts to melt and boil off, along with particles of dust.
These particles and gases make a cloud around the nucleus, called a coma. The coma is lit by the Sun.
The sunlight also pushes this material into the beautiful brightly lit tail of the comet.

85 Which of the following correctly represents the concept of human capital?
a)  Total adult population of the country
b)  Total population
c)  Human resources gainfully employed in productive activities
d)  Total physical assets created by humans
Answer: C
 Human capital is a measure of the economic value of an employee's skill set.
This measure builds on the basic production input of labor measure where all labor is thought to be equal.
The concept of human capital recognizes that not all labor is equal and that the quality of employees can be improved by investing in them.
The education, experience and abilities of an employee have an economic value for employers and for the economy as a whole.

86 Why does the share of agriculture in developing economies tend to decline when national economy is growing rapidly?
1.  With greater development food tends to treated like an inferior commodity.
2.  Agriculture generally does not grow as fast as industrial sector even if the economy is growing very fast.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
User Name :      Kant
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 An inferior good is a good that decreases in demand when consumer income rises (or rises in demand when consumer income decreases), unlike normal goods, for which the opposite is observed.
With more development the share of spending on food items reduces gradually, and that on non-food items like consumer durables, luxuries etc increase. This slows down the growth of agriculture. So, 1 is correct.
Moreover, agriculture is constrained by several factors like technology, climate change, land availability, disasters, soil degradation etc which have limited agricultural growth to less than 4% annually in India; whereas industry can comfortable grow at 8-10% annually.
So, 2 is also correct.

87 "Black Foot" disease in human beings caused due to use of water contaminated with
a)  Mercury
b)  Cadmium
c)  Silver
d)  Arsenic
Answer: D
 Drinking water rich in arsenic over a long period leads to arsenic poisoning or arsenicosis, also known as the Black foot disease.
Drinking arsenic-rich water over a long period results in various health effects including skin problems (such as colour changes on the skin, and hard patches on
the palms and soles of the feet), skin cancer, cancers of the bladder, kidney and lung,

92 Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) is an important initiative aiming at
a)  Providing medical facilities for adolescents in every primary school
b)  Post-birth immediate insurance coverage of all health related problems
c)  Early identification and early intervention for children from birth to adulthood for developmental delays and birth defects
d)  Free provision of nutritional supplements and essential medicines for new
born children
Answer: C
 According to March of Dimes (2006), out of every 100 babies born in this country annually, 6 to 7 have a birth defect. This would translate to around 17 lakhs birth defects annually in the country and accounts for 9.6% of all the newborn deaths.
So, RBSK aims at early identification and early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 'D's viz. Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, Development delays including disability.
Early detection and management diseases including deficiencies bring added value in preventing these conditions to progress to its more severe and debilitating form and thereby reducing hospitalization and improving implementation of Right to Education.

93 The Bakasht lands issue became a major ground of contention between the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha and the Congress Ministry. The Bakasht land movement continued till 1945 till zamindari was abolished. What were Bakasht lands?
User Name :      Kant
a)  Lands confiscated by the government
b)  Lands claimed by the landlords from tenants who have held them for innumerable years
c)  Lands tilled by the small farmers but owned by the Zamindars on behalf of the government
d)  Lands on which Zamindars received no rent
Answer: B
 The Congress Ministry had initiated legislation for the reduction of rent and the restoration of Bakasht lands.
Bakasht lands were those which the occupancy tenants had lost to zamindars, mostly during the Depression years, by virtue of nonpayment of rent, and which they often continued to cultivate as share-croppers.
But the formula that was finally incorporated in the legislation on the basis of an agreement with the zamindars did not satisfy the radical leaders of the kisan Sabha.
The legislation gave a certain proportion of the lands back to the tenants on condition that they pay half the auction price of the land. Besides, certain categories of land had been exempted from the operation of the law.

Statement 2: In the period 1914-1947, the capitalist class grew rapidly, increasing its strength and self-confidence.
This was achieved primarily through import substitution; by edging out or encroaching upon areas of European domination, and by establishing almost exclusive control over new areas thus accounting for the bulk of the new investments made since the 1920s.
Statement 3: Colonial policies actually hampered their growth, for e.g. discriminating protection policies skewed the industrial base in India. Trade policies ensured that Indian manufactured goods remain uncompetitive abroad.

a)  The total debt that the Government of India owes to the domestic markets
b)  The total liability of the monetary authority of the country
c)  Total reserves of all commercial banks registered with RBI
d)  Currency held by the public which is in circulation and cash reserves of commercial banks
Answer: B
 The total liability of the monetary authority of the country, RBI, is called the monetary base or high powered money.
It consists of currency (notes and coins in circulation with the public and vault cash of commercial banks) and deposits held by the Government of India and commercial banks with RBI.
If a member of the public produces a currency note to RBI the latter must pay her value equal to the figure printed on the note.
Similarly, the deposits are also refundable by RBI on demand from deposit-holders. These items are claims which the general public, government or banks have on RBI
and hence are considered to be the liability of RBI.

c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: D
 Statement R: Fold Mountains are caused by large-scale earth's movements, when stresses may be due to the increased load of the underlying rocks, flow movements in the mantle, magnetic intrusions into the crust, or the expansion or contraction of some part of the earth.
When such stresses are initiated, the rocks are subjected to compressive forces that produce wrinkling or folding along the lines of weakness. So, R is clearly wrong.
Statement A: Since the rock strata have been elevated to great heights, sometimes measurable in kilometres, Fold Mountains may be called mountains of elevation. The Fold Mountains are also closely associated with volcanic activity. They contain
many active volcanoes especially in the Circum-Pacific fold mountain system. So, A
is also wrong.
