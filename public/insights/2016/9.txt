1 What do you understand by the term "Environmental determinism"?
a)  It is a belief that a physical environment affects social and cultural development.
b)  It is a process which shows how an individual organism adjusts to a gradual change in its environment.
c)  It is the belief that human behaviour is controlled solely by an individual's physiology.
d)  It shows that cross-cultural and historical diversity results are not caused due
to differences in environment.
Answer: A
 Option (b) is similar to "Acclimatization". Option (c) is Biological determinism.
The most appropriate option is (a), as it is the belief that the physical environment predisposes human social development towards particular trajectories.
 The fundamental argument of the environmental determinists was that aspects of physical geography, particularly climate, influenced the psychological mind-set of individuals, which in turn defined the behaviour and culture of the society that those individuals formed.
For e.g., tropical climates were said to cause laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle latitudes led to more determined and driven work ethics and thus more civilized and 'stronger' societies.
The theory that opposes it is Possibilism. It argues that the environment only sets certain constraints or limitations, but culture is otherwise determined by social conditions.
Neodeterminism or stop and go determinism is the middle way between both concepts.

2 Which of the following is/are the salient features of Chalukyan administration when compared to the Pallavas and Cholas?
1.  The Chalukya administration was highly decentralized unlike that of the Pallavas and the Cholas.
2.  The Chalukyas did not maintain maritime power unlike Pallavas and Cholas.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 The Chalukya administration was highly centralized unlike that of the Pallavas and the Cholas. Village autonomy was absent under the Chalukyas. So, 1 is incorrect.
The system of village autonomy with sabhas and their committees developed through the ages and reached its culmination during the Chola rule.
The Chalukyas had a great maritime power. Pulakesin II had 100 ships in his navy. They also had a small standing army. So, 2 is incorrect.
The Cholas paid special attention to their navy. The naval achievements of the
Tamils reached its climax under the Cholas.

3 The President has recently assented to the Sugar Cess (Amendment) Bill, 2015 to raise the ceiling of a cess as an excise duty on the production of sugar. The additional cess burden will accrue to the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) and used for
1.  Setting up of ethanol plants
2.  Setting up of cogeneration power projects
3.  Rehabilitation of potentially sick viable sugar undertaking
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Sugar Development Fund (SDF) can be used for:
Development of cane in their areas; Rehabilitation/Modernisation projects; Setting up of ethanol plants; Setting up of cogeneration power projects; Rehabilitation of potentially sick viable sugar undertaking etc.
Cane growers can apply for a loan from the SDF for these projects.
The Bill proposes to increase this ceiling of sugar to Rs 200 per quintal from existing Rs 25 per quintal specified in the principal Act.
The principal Act empowers central government to fix the rate of sugar cess from time to time.
Implications of hike in sugar cess: It would lead to increase in the accruals to the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) which in turn would facilitate rehabilitation and modernisation of sugar mills and thereby helping cane growers. In present scenario, it will help in revival of stagnant sugar economy by helping cash-starved mills and sugarcane growers.

4 The Kepler spacecraft launched by NASA in 2009 was tasked with
a)  Determining how commonly Earth-like planets occur throughout the Milky Way galaxy
b)  Probing the surface of exo-planets like Pluto
c)  Establishing inter-galaxial communication using radio waves
d)  Understanding the pattern of solar spots from orbiting nearest possible to the Sun
Answer: A
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA's) revamped planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft has discovered more than 100 planets orbiting
other stars.
The Kepler spacecraft finds the planets by using the transit method. It is detection of the tiny brightness dips caused by the planet after it crosses its host star's face from spacecraft's perspective.
Transit method technique requires extremely precise pointing of spacecraft.

5 Histamine is related to
1.  Secretion of acid in stomach
2.  Allergy from pollen grains
3.  Nasal congestion associated with common cold
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Histamine stimulates the secretion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
A drug cimetidine (Tegamet), was designed to prevent the interaction of histamine with the receptors present in the stomach wall. This resulted in release of lesser amount of acid. The importance of the drug was so much that it remained the largest selling drug in the world until another drug, ranitidine (Zantac), was discovered.
Statement 2 & 3 and additional info: Histamine is a potent vasodilator. It has various functions. It contracts the smooth muscles in the bronchi and gut and relaxes other muscles, such as those in the walls of fine blood vessels. Histamine is also responsible for the nasal congestion associated with common cold and allergic response to pollen.

6 If the total population of a country is increasing, it necessarily means that
1.  Population growth rate is increasing.
2.  Total fertility rate is increasing
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Growth rate need not increase. Even if it is constant or negative, total population can grow. For e.g. if 2013 population grew at 5%, in 2014 at 4%, even then total population increases. So, 1 is wrong.
Population may increase due to immigration and low death rates too. So, 2 is not necessarily correct.

7 An age-sex pyramid of a nation must become broader at the base if
a)  The sex ratio declines.
b)  There are more females adults than males.
c)  Men and women have equal population.
d)  Fertility rate is high.
Answer: D
 Even if sex-ratio declines, if total child population is constant, pyramid will not flatten at the base. So, (a) is incorrect.
Base shows child population, not adult population. So, (b) is wrong.
If men and women have equal population for all ages, the pyramid may shows vertically symmetry. It will not flatten the base. So, (c) is wrong.

8 Which of the following argument(s) support biological control of pests and plant diseases?
1.  Increased biodiversity furthers plant health.
2.  Chemical methods of pest control kill both useful and harmful agents indiscriminately.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
  In agriculture, there is a method of controlling pests that relies on natural predation rather than introduced chemicals. A key belief of the organic farmer is that biodiversity furthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable it is. So, 1 is correct.
The organic farmer, therefore, works to create a system where the insects that are sometimes called pests are not eradicated, but instead are kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances within a living and vibrant ecosystem.
The organic farmer holds the view that the eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests is not only possible, but also undesirable, for without them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon them as food or hosts would not be able to survive. So, 2 is correct.

9 Which of the following statements is INCORRECT about fermentation?
1.  It can occur only in yeast and bacteria.
2.  It must be carried out in an anaerobic environment.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases or alcohol. It occurs in yeast and bacteria, and also in oxygen-starved muscle cells, as in the case of lactic acid fermentation. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: Fermentation does not necessarily have to be carried out in an
anaerobic environment. For example, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, yeast cells greatly prefer fermentation to aerobic respiration, as long as sugars are readily available for consumption. So, 2 is also wrong.

10 If the proportion of people engaged in primary activities in a nation is high, which of the following conclusions may be appropriately drawn from it?
a)  The nation is a closed economy.
b)  Extraction of natural resources is a major activity in the economy
c)  Levels of urbanizations are very low in the country.
d)  Large parts of population are illiterate.
Answer: B
 A nation can be a closed or an open economy. For e.g. in India the number is high at around 50%, but it is an open economy. (a) is wrong.
Primary activities involve Extraction of natural resources like mining, agriculture etc. So, (b) is correct.
In India urbanization stands at 32%, yet 50% or more work in primary sector. (c) is not correct.
Option (d) need not be true. India is a classic example.

11 The "Basic Needs Approach" to human development was initially proposed by the
International Labour Organisation (ILO). The approach advocates
a)  Higher the level of income, the higher is the level of human b)  People should be made participants in development not only its passive recipients.
c)  Building human capabilities in terms of knowledge and basic capabilities
d)  Ignoring human choices and fulfilling basic needs of defined sections
Answer: D
 Basic needs approaches to well-being are concerned with outcomes. They arose out of recognition that economic approaches to development that focused on incomes and growth were problematic.
A narrow economic understanding sees increasing incomes and faster growth as proxies for improved well-being.
However, basic needs proponents argue that this depends, firstly, on whether income is spent on satisfying basic needs where there are shortfalls or on luxuries that may ultimately have a detrimental impact on well-being and, secondly, on how income and the positive welfare benefits of increased income are distributed between and within different social groups.
Basic needs approaches focus on key indicators that are seen as objective assessments of well-being such as longevity, infant survival, body mass index, educational attainment, and so on.

12 In anaerobic sludge digesters waste decomposing bacteria produce which of these gases?
1.  Methane
2.  Hydrogen sulphide
3.  Carbon dioxide
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Anaerobic digestion is particularly suited to organic material, and is commonly used for industrial effluent, wastewater and sewage sludge treatment.
Anaerobic digestion, a simple process, can greatly reduce the amount of organic matter which might otherwise be destined to be dumped at sea, dumped in landfills, or burnt in incinerators.
Using anaerobic digestion technologies can help to reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases in a number of key ways:
Replacement of fossil fuels
Reducing or eliminating the energy footprint of waste treatment plants
Reducing methane emission from landfills Displacing industrially produced chemical fertilizers Reducing vehicle movements
Reducing electrical grid transportation losses
Reducing usage of LP Gas for cooking

13 Which of the following is/are the benefit(s) of "tissue culture"?
1.  Possibility of recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants
2.  Production of multiples of plants in the absence of seeds
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 It is a collection of techniques used to maintain or grow plant cells, tissues or organs under sterile conditions on a nutrient culture medium of known composition.
It is widely used to produce clones of a plant in a method known as micropropagation.
Advantages over traditional methods of propagation:
The production of exact copies of plants that produce particularly good flowers, fruits, or have other desirable traits.
To quickly produce mature plants.
The production of multiples of plants in the absence of seeds or necessary pollinators to produce seeds.
The regeneration of whole plants from plant cells that have been genetically modified.
The production of plants in sterile containers that allows them to be moved
with greatly reduced chances of transmitting diseases, pests, and pathogens. The production of plants from seeds that otherwise have very low chances of germinating and growing, i.e.: orchids and Nepenthes.
To clean particular plants of viral and other infections and to quickly multiply these plants as 'cleaned stock' for horticulture and agriculture.
Plant tissue culture relies on the fact that many plant cells have the ability to regenerate a whole plant (totipotency).

14 The practices of 'Milpa' in America and 'Ladang' in Indonesia and Malaysia are related to
a)  Shifting cultivation
b)  Intensive Mixed farming
c)  Traditional commercial Livestock Rearing
d)  Nomadic Herding based on indigenous traditions
Answer: A
 The vegetation is usually cleared by fire, and the ashes add to the fertility of the soil.
Shifting cultivation is thus, also called slash and burn agriculture. The cultivated patches are very small and cultivation is done with very primitive tools such as sticks and hoes.
After sometime (3 to 5 years) the soil looses its fertility and the farmer shifts to another parts and clears other patch of the forest for cultivation. The farmer may return to the earlier patch after sometime.
One of the major problems of shifting cultivation is that the cycle of jhum becomes less and less due to loss of fertility in different parcels. It is prevalent in tropical region in different names, e.g. Jhuming in North eastern states of India, Milpa in central America and Mexico and Ladang in Indonesia and Malaysia.

15 Zabti or Bandobast system during the reign of Akbar is related to
a)  Land revenue system
b)  Annexation of enemy territories
c)  Mansabdari system
d)  Welfare of travellers
Answer: A
 The land revenue system of Akbar was called Zabti or Bandobast system. It was further improved by Raja Todar Mal. It was known as Dahsala System which was completed in 1580.
By this system, Todar Mal introduced a uniform system of land measurement. The revenue was fixed on the average yield of land assessed on the basis of past ten years.
The land was also divided into four categories – Polaj (cultivated every year), Parauti (once in two years), Chachar (once in three or four years) and Banjar (once in five or more years). Payment of revenue was made generally in cash.

16 Viticulture or grape cultivation is a speciality of the Mediterranean region. What is in the Mediterranean climate that supports growing grapes?
1.  Long growing seasons of moderate to warm temperatures
2.  Very low precipitation in grape growing seasons that support grape vegetation
Which of the above is correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The presence of adequate sun, heat and water are all vital to the healthy growth and development of grapevines during the growing season.
In general, grapevines thrive in temperate climates which grant the vines long, warm periods during the crucial flowering, fruit set and ripening periods. So, 1 is correct.
On average, a grapevine needs around 710 mm (28 in) of water for sustenance during the growing season, not all of which may be provided by natural rain fall. In Mediterranean and many continental climates, the climate during the growing season may be quite dry and require additional irrigation. So, 2 is incorrect.
However, the advantage of Mediterranean agriculture is that more valuable crops such as fruits and vegetables are grown in winters when there is great demand in European and North American markets

17 Which of the following is/are the difference(s) between a free trade area and Customs
Union?
1.  All restrictions on trade and investment are removed in a free trade area, but not in a customs union.
2.  Customs Union has a common external tariff for members, but a free trade area does not.
3.  Free trade area does not allow free movement of people, but Customs union does.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1, 2 and 3
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
  The degree of economic integration can be categorized into seven stages:
Preferential trading area
Free trade area Customs union Common market Economic union
Economic and monetary union
Complete economic integration
These differ in the degree of unification of economic policies, with the highest one being the completed economic integration of the states, which would most likely involve political integration as well.
A "free trade area" (FTa) is formed when at least two states partially or fully
abolish custom tariffs on their inner border. However, this may not include complete abolition on investment flow. So, 1 is incorrect.
A "customs union" introduces unified tariffs on the exterior borders of the union
(CET, common external tariffs).
A "monetary union" introduces a shared currency.
A "common market" add to a FTA the free movement of services, capital and labor
(not a Customs Union). So, 3 is incorrect.
An "economic union" combines customs union with a common market. A "fiscal union" introduces a shared fiscal and budgetary policy.
Human 
18 AIDS caused by the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV) can spread by
1.  Transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products
2.  Infected mother to her child through placenta
3.  Touching infected patients
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
  HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it spreads only through body fluids. So, 3 is incorrect.
Transmission of HIV-infection generally occurs by (a) sexual contact with infected person, (b) by transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products, (c) by sharing infected needles as in the case of intravenous drug abusers and (d) from infected mother to her child through placenta. So, 1 and 2 are correct.
So, people who are at high risk of getting this infection includes - individuals who have multiple sexual partners, drug addicts who take drugs intravenously,
individuals who require repeated blood transfusions and children born to an HIV
infected mother.

19 In which of the following regions extensive commercial grain cultivation is practised?
1.  Interior parts of Southeast Asia
2.  Pampas of Argentina
3.  European Steppes
4.  Amazon Basin
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: D
 Statement 1 and 4: Gathering is practised in: (i) high latitude zones which include northern Canada, northern Eurasia and southern Chile; (ii) Low latitude zones such as the Amazon Basin, tropical Africa, Northern fringe of Australia and the interior parts of Southeast Asia.
Statement 2 and 3: Extensive commercial grain cultivation is best developed in Eurasian steppes, the Canadian and American Prairies, the Pampas of Argentina, the Velds of South Africa, the Australian Downs and the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand.

20 Which of the following industries is/are footloose industries?
1.  Sugar
2.  Cotton textiles
3.  Vegetable oils
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
  Foot loose industries can be located in a wide variety of places. They are not dependent on any specific raw material, weight losing or otherwise.
Since cotton, oil and sugar industries require raw materials and cannot be established anywhere, 1, 2 and 3 all are wrong.
They largely depend on component parts which can be obtained anywhere. They produce in small quantity and also employ a small labour force.
These are generally not polluting industries. The important factor in their location is accessibility by road network.

21 The culture of wearing masks can be found in
1.  Indus Valley civilization
2.  Natya Shashtra
3.  Pre-historic civilizations
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
JustificationStatement 1: Excavations have revealed small hollow masks dating back to the Indus Valley Civilisation. In fact in Bihar a terracotta mask of the fourth century has also been excavated.
Statement 2: The Natya Shastra speaks of masks and their use in theatre. Here it is mentioned that masks can be made of ground paddy husks applied to cloth.
Statement 3: The earliest traces of human existence go back to the period between
3,00,000 and 2,00,000 BC. The modern human being first appeared around 36000
BC. The origin of the mask has been traced to pre-historic man. Depictions of masks have been found in various rock paintings and cave paintings. Masks were probably used for hunting and taming animals and for their primeval dances.

22 Highways in Russia are not as important as railways. Why?
a)  Criss-crossing of rivers across the major transportation zones
b)  Subsidence zones and weak soil that collapse at high loads
c)  Magnetic activity is unusual that prevents laying down of metallic roads
d)  Vast geographical expanse
Answer: D
If option (a) was correct, it should have been logically correct for railways too. So, it can't be the answer.
Same is true for option (b). Option (c) is absurd.
In Russia, a dense highway network is developed in the industrialised region west of the Urals with Moscow as the hub. The important Moscow-Vladivostok Highway serves the region to the east. Due to the vast geographical area, highways in Russia are not as important as railways.

2.  He was a devout follower of Saivism.
3.  He completed the construction of the famous Brihadeeswara temple at Tanjore.
4.  His last military achievement was a naval expedition against the Maldive Islands which were conquered.
The above refer to?
a)  Amoghavarsha I
b)  Kulottunga I
c)  Rajaraja I
d)  Pulakesin II
Answer: C
 It was under Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra I that the Chola power reached its highest point of glory.
By his military conquests, the extent of the Chola empire under Rajaraja I included the Pandya, Chera and the Tondaimandalam regions of Tamil Nadu and the Gangavadi, Nolambapadi and the Telugu Choda territories in the Deccan and the northern part of Ceylon and the Maldive Islands beyond India.
He completed the construction of the famous Rajarajeswara temple or Brihadeeswara temple at Tanjore in 1010 A.D. He also helped in the construction of a Buddhist monastery at Nagapattinam.

24 Consider the following comparing Coastal shipping with rail or road transport.
1.  Coastal cargo vessels emit more carbon dioxide per tonne of cargo moved.
2.  Fuel consumption per tonne of cargo moved is more for coastal shipping.
3.  Cost of coast-to-coast transportation is lesser in coastal shipping.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: C
Refer to the image below.
In India, coastal shipping moves just 7% of the local freight despite a coastline of
7,517km dotted with 12 state-owned ports and around 200 smaller harbours. The share is low compared with the European Union, where coastal shipping has a 43% share of the cargo traffic. In the US, it has a 15% share.

25 Which of the following is most likely to survive in deep ocean waters?
a)  Brown Algae
b)  Red Algae
c)  Green Algae
d)  Yellow Algae
Answer: B
Light is a limiting factor for life in deep oceans. Not all the colour components of the visible spectrum are available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean.
Sunlight is broken into its seven component colours as it penetrates through the ocean water by dispersion. Longer wavelengths cannot penetrate deeper whereas shorter wavelengths do.
 Algae use photosynthesis to manufacture food. So, the ones utilizing the short wavelength for photosynthesis survive.
Red algae have red pigment (phycoerythrin) which carries out photosynthesis using only short wavelength light found in greater depths.
They can be found as deep as 200 m in ocean water.

26 Consider the following about 'Acquired immunity' in human beings?
1.  It is pathogen specific.
2.  It is based on memory of disease attack and response.
3.  It is present at the time of birth.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Statement 1 and 2: This means that our body when it encounters a pathogen for the first time produces a response called primary response which is of low intensity.
Subsequent encounter with the same pathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response. This is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the first encounter. So, 1 and 2 are correct.
Statement 3: It is "innate immunity" which is present at time of birth. It prevents the entry of the foreign agents into our body when our bodies are weak.

27 Use of aspartame is limited to cold foods and soft drinks and not cooked meals because
a)  It becomes toxic when mixed with greasy substances.
b)  It is unstable at cooking temperature.
c)  It is too sweet to be used in normal food items.
d)  It is a volatile sweetener and needs to be stored at cold temperatures.
Answer: B
 Aspartame is one of the most common artificial sweeteners in use today
Aspartame is used in many foods and beverages because it is about 100-200 times sweeter than sugar, so much less of it can be used to give the same level of sweetness. This, in turn, lowers the calories in the food or beverage.
In the body, aspartame is broken down into phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol. Methanol can be toxic in high amounts, but the amounts that result from the breakdown of aspartame is lower than with many "natural" foods.

28 The Union Government has launched Ganga Gram Yojana. Consider the following about it.
1.  Villages situated along the banks of river Ganga will be developed under this scheme.
2.  It would be mandatory for every household in the selected villages to have functional toilets.
3.  The scheme proposes banning any polluting industry in these villages.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: A
 The Union Government has launched Ganga Gram Yojana to develop
1600 villages in Uttar Pradesh (UP) situated along the banks of Ganga River.
In these selected villages open drains discharging waste directly into river
Ganga will be diverted to sewage treatment facility.
Government will spend one crore rupees on every village under this programme.
It would be mandatory for every household in selected villages to have functional toilets.
Under this programme, these selected villages will be developed under the
Sichewal model (Village in Punjab) which is based on cooperation of the
villagers for water management and waste disposal.

29 OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) consists of
1.  Indonesia
2.  Venezuela
3.  Nigeria
4.  Ecuador
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2, 3 and 4
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
The OPEC Statute distinguishes between the Founder Members and Full Members - those countries whose applications for membership have been accepted by the Conference.
The Statute stipulates that "any country with a substantial net export of crude petroleum, which has fundamentally similar interests to those of Member Countries, may become a Full Member of the Organization, if accepted by a majority of three- fourths of Full Members, including the concurring votes of all Founder Members."
So, even countries outside the middle-east like Indonesia can become members.

30 A nation with negative Balance of payments (BoP) is out of foreign exchange reserves. Which of the following agencies can it approach to avert the BoP crisis?
a)  United Nations Trusteeship Council (UNTC)
b)  Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI)
c)  World Trade Organization (WTO)
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 The answer will be International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The organization's objectives stated in the Articles of Agreement are:[6] to promote international monetary cooperation, international trade, high employment,
exchange-rate stability, sustainable economic growth, and making resources available to member countries in financial difficulty.
Member countries of the IMF have access to information on the economic policies of all member countries, the opportunity to influence other members' economic policies, technical assistance in banking, fiscal affairs, and exchange matters, financial support in times of payment difficulties, and increased opportunities for trade and investment

31 The term "Sub Urbanisation" refers to
a)  A pattern of urbanization where commercial and residential places are completely separated
b)  Movement of people from congested urban areas to nearby satellite communities
c)  Reduction of population in lower tier cities
d)  Movement of population from urban areas to rural areas
Answer: B
It is a new trend of people moving away from congested urban areas to cleaner areas outside the city in search of a better quality of living. Important suburbs develop around major cities and everyday thousands of people commute from their homes in the sub urbs to their work places in the city
Option (a) is somewhat similar (but not same) to commuter towns. Option (c) is a trend of concentration in metropolitan cities.
Option (d) is called counter-urbanization.

32 Hybrid breed crops in India can be found in
1.  Maize
2.  Wheat
3.  Garden Peas
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Wheat and Rice: During the period 1960 to 2000, wheat production increased from 11 million tones to 75 million tonnes while rice production went up
from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes. This was due to the development of semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice.
Sugar cane: Saccharum barberi was originally grown in north India, but had poor sugar content and yield. Tropical canes grown in south India Saccharum officinarum had thicker stems and higher sugar content but did not grow well in north India. These two species were successfully crossed to get sugar cane varieties combining the desirable qualities of high yield, thick stems, high sugar and ability to grow in the sugar cane areas of north India.
Millets: Hybrid maize, jowar and bajra have been successfully developed in India. Hybrid breeding have led to the development of several high yielding varieties resistant to water stress.

33 Consider the following about Madhubani paintings.
1.  Traditionally women are not allowed to paint Madhubani paintings.
2.  Nature themes are not included.
3.  The art has not been officially recognized.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Madhubani painting/Mithila painting was traditionally created by the women of the Brahman, Dusadh and Kayastha communities in Mithila region in Nepal and India. So, 1 is incorrect.
Statement 2: Originally the paintings depicted an assembly of symbolic images of the lotus plant, the bamboo grove, fishes, birds and snakes in union. These images represented fertility and proliferation of life. So, 2 is incorrect too.
Statement 3: Madhubani painting received official recognition in 1975, when the President of India gave Padma Shri award to Jagdamba Devi, of Jitwarpur village near Madhubani. In 1981 Sita Devi was awarded by Padma Shri , In 1990, Ganga Devi of Mithila was awarded Padma Shri. Other painters, Mahasundari Devi (2008), Godavari Dutt, Bharti Dayal and Bua Devi were also given National award. So, 3 is incorrect.

34 Single Cell Protein (SCP) can be made available for human consumption by
1.  Growing microbes on an industrial scale
2.  Genetically modifying plant cells to trigger nutrient production
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Single-cell protein (SCP) refers to edible unicellular microorganisms.
The biomass or protein extract from pure or mixed cultures of algae, yeasts, fungi or bacteria may be used as an ingredient or a substitute for protein-rich foods, and is suitable for human consumption or as animal feeds.
Benefits: Whereas industrial agriculture is marked by a high water footprint, high land use, biodiversity destruction, general environmental degradation and contributes to climate change by emission of a third of all greenhouse gases,
production of SCP does not necessarily exhibit any of these serious drawbacks.
As of today, SCP is commonly grown on agricultural waste products, and as such inherits the ecological footprint and water footprint of industrial agriculture.
However, SCP may also be produced entirely independent of agricultural waste products through autotrophic growth.

39 Chhau dance is a genre of
a)  Indian tribal martial dance
b)  Yakshagana of Karnataka
c)  Devotional puppet dance
d)  Spiritual invocations to achieve rich harvest
Answer: A
 Chhau is a style performed exclusively by men from the triangular area where Bihar, Bengal and Orissa meet. This is the tribal belt of India home to the tribal groups of Bhulya, Santhals, Mundas, Hos and Oraons.
In the olden days the powerful Ganga and Gajapati rulers of Orissa extended their
territory from the river Ganges in the north to the Godavari in the south with the help of a vast army of valiant Paikas.
They were not in the regular payroll of the army, but received huge land grants from the kings and the chieftains. They formed the rank of a peasant-militia. Though agriculture was their main occupation they used to keep themselves prepared by regular practice and training in war techniques.

40 Agglomeration Economies between industries are formed due to
a)  Proximity
b)  Common raw material
c)  Common customers
d)  Common technology
Answer: A
Many industries benefit from nearness to a leader-industry and other industries. These benefits are termed as agglomeration economies.
Savings are derived from the linkages which exist between different industries. These factors operate together to determine industrial location.

The mashak is a type of bagpipe found in Northern India and parts of
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
It is usually played by the Dholis as accompaniment to popular folk melodies. The pipe was associated with weddings and festive occasions. In India it is
historically found in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
This bagpipe uses single reeds, and can be played either as a drone or as a melody instrument.

42 Organisms of which of the following species may undergo aestivation?
1.  Snails
2.  Fishes
3.  Crocodiles
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
In animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the stress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into hibernation during winter is an example of escape in time.
Some snails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer-related problems-heat and dessication. Under unfavourable conditions many zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter diapause, a stage of suspended development.

43 The Battle of Tarain is related to
a)  The Hindu princes of north India fighting against Muhammad Ghori
b)  The battle between the Marathas and Rajputs
c)  Revolt in Gujarati kingdom against Mahmud of Ghazni
d)  Land battles in Sind between Muslim princes
Answer: A
The Hindu princes of north India formed a confederacy under the command of Prithiviraj Chauhan.
Prithviraj defeated Ghori in the battle of Tarain near Delhi in 1191 A.D.
In the ensuing Second Battle of Tarain in 1192, Muhammad Ghori thoroughly routed the army of Prithiviraj, who was captured and killed.
The second battle of Tarain was a decisive battle. It was a major disaster for the
Rajputs. Their political prestige suffered a serious setback.
The whole Chauhan kingdom now lay at the feet of the invader. The first Muslim kingdom was thus firmly established in India at Ajmer and a new era in the history of India began.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
The reign of Firoz Tughlaq was more notable for his administration. He strictly followed the advice of the ulemas in running the administration.
He pleased the nobles and assured hereditary succession to their properties. Thus the iqta system was not only revived but also it was made hereditary.
As per the Islamic law he levied the taxes. Jiziya was strictly imposed on non- Muslims. He was the first Sultan to impose irrigation tax. But at the same time he dug irrigation canals and wells.

46 Indiscriminate use of antibiotics causes anti-biotic resistance. This can happen due to
1.  Natural selection in bacteria in reaction to anti-biotics
2.  Colonization resistance mechanism
3.  Attack of clonal bacteria on the host immune system
4.  By genetic mutation in the bacteria
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
Concept:Antibiotic resistance occurs when an antibiotic has lost its ability to effectively control or kill bacterial growth; in other words, the bacteria are "resistant" and continue to multiply in the presence of therapeutic levels of an antibiotic.
Statement 1: The evolution of resistant strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms replicate themselves erroneously or when resistant traits are exchanged between them. The use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of drug-resistant strains. So, 1 is correct.
Statement 3 and 4: Some bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics. However, bacteria may also become resistant in two ways: 1) by a genetic mutation or 2) by acquiring resistance from another bacterium.
Mutations, rare spontaneous changes of the bacteria's genetic material, are thought to occur in about one in one million to one in ten million cells. Some mutations enable the bacteria to produce potent chemicals (enzymes) that inactivate antibiotics, while other mutations eliminate the cell target that the antibiotic attacks.
Statement 2: Colonization resistance is the mechanism whereby the in

47 Same substances can act as an antiseptic as well as disinfectant by
1.  Varying its concentration
2.  Using it on inanimate surfaces instead of animate biological surfaces
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Disinfectants are applied to inanimate objects such as floors, drainage system, instruments, etc. Same substances can act as an antiseptic as well as disinfectant by varying the concentration.
For example, 0.2 per cent solution of phenol is an antiseptic while its one percent solution is disinfectant.
Chlorine in the concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 ppm in aqueous solution and sulphur dioxide in very low concentrations, are disinfectants. So, 1 is correct.
The surface, animate or inanimate, does not cause this difference. So, 2 is incorrect.

48 Chemicals are added to food for their preservation, enhancing their appeal, and to add nutritive value in them. Which of the following additives have nutritive value?
1.  Fat emulsifiers and stabilising agents

3.  Food colours
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Main categories of food additives are as follows:
Food colours
Flavours and sweeteners
Fat emulsifiers and stabilising agents
Flour improvers - antistaling agents and bleaches
Antioxidants
Preservatives
Nutritional supplements such as minerals, vitamins and amino acids.
Except for Nutritional supplements, none of the above additives have nutritive
value. These are added either to increase the shelf life of stored food or for cosmetic purposes.

49 Under the Delhi sultanate muqtis or walis
a)  Maintained law and order and collected the land revenue
b)  Managed financial accounts of central treasury
c)  Lead mercenary military units in special warfares
d)  Administered village assemblies
Answer: A
The provinces under the Delhi Sultanate were called iqtas. They were initially under the control of the nobles.
But the governors of the provinces were called the muqtis or walis. They were to maintain law and order and collect the land revenue.
The provinces were divided into shiqs and the next division was pargana. The shiq was under the control of shiqdar.
The pargana comprising a number of villages was headed by amil.
The village remained the basic unit of the administration. The village headman was known as muqaddam or chaudhri. The village accountant was called patwari.

50 Which of the following is NOT a valid argument for advocating 'free trade' for a developing economy?
a)  It results in more efficient allocation of resources internationally.
b)  It improves competition and reduces domestic monopoly in goods and services.
c)  It allows exporters to reap economies of scale.
d)  It creates a level-playing field between developing and developed economies.
Answer: D
Since it allows specialization of production, (a) is correct. Option (b) is a natural consequence of more producers of the same product or service.
Since exporters can tap domestic as well as foreign markets, they can produce more, reduce costs and thus reap economies of scale. So, (c) is also correct.
Option (d) is not a valid argument out of the all four. Globalisation along with free trade can adversely affect the economies of developing countries by not giving equal playing field by imposing conditions which are unfavourable.
With the development of transport and communication systems goods and services can travel faster and farther than ever before. But free trade should not only let rich countries enter
the markets, but allow the developed countries to keep their own markets protected from foreign products.

51 Desert plants have which of the following adaptations for survival?
1.  Stomata arranged in deep pits to minimise water loss through transpiration
2.  Special photosynthetic pathway enabling their stomata to remain closed during day time
3.  Roots performing photosynthetic functions instead of thorny or no leaves
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
Many desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and have their stomata arranged in deep pits to minimise water loss through transpiration. So,
1 is correct.
They also have a special photosynthetic pathway (CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time. So, 1 is correct.
Some desert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves-they are reduced to spinesÐand the photosynthetic function is taken over by the flattened stems. So, 3 is correct.

52 Under the WTO agreements, countries cannot normally discriminate between their trading partners– a treatment which is known as "Most favoured Nation (MFN)" status. However some discrimination is allowed when
1.  Countries can set up a free trade agreement that applies only to goods traded within the group
2.  They can give developing countries special access to their markets
3.  A country can raise barriers against products that are considered to be traded unfairly from specific countries
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Exceptions to MFN principle: For example, countries can set up a free trade agreement that applies only
to goods traded within the group- discriminating against goods from outside, for e.g. SAFTA or TPP.
Or they can give developing countries special access to their markets, for e.g. agricultural markets.
Or a country can raise barriers against products that are considered to be traded unfairly from specific countries, for e.g. guns and ammunition.
And in services, countries are allowed, in limited circumstances, to discriminate, as under TRIMS.
But the agreements only permit these exceptions under strict conditions.
In general, MFN means that every time a country lowers a trade barrier or opens up a market, it has to do so for the same goods or services from all its trading partners - whether rich or poor, weak or strong.

53 Which one of the following types of cultivation was developed by European colonists in
India?
1.  Kolkoz
2.  Mixed farming
3.  Plantation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
A kolkhoz was a form of collective farm in the Soviet Union. Kolkhozes existed along with state farms. So, 1 is incorrect.
Mixed farming was always practiced in India even before colonialism. So, 2 is also incorrect.
British introduced plantation agriculture in tea, coffee, tobacco, indigo etc and commercialized Indian agriculture. So, 3 is correct.

54 Consider the following statements. Assertion (a): Consuming carcinogenic substances consistently for long durations may result in cell tumours. Reason (R): In cancer, cell growth and differentiation becomes uncontrolled and difficult to regulate by the body. In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R can be an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R cannot be an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory mechanisms.
Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by virtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.
Cancer cells appear to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.

55 Which of following criteria is most useful to differentiate an Indian urban area from a rural area?
a)  Literacy rates
b)  Occupational structure
c)  Sex ratio
d)  Growth rate of population
Answer: B
 The census of India, 2011 defines urban settlements as "All places which have municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee and have a minimum population of 5000 persons, at least 75 per cent of male workers are engaged in non-agricultural pursuits and a density of population of at least 400 persons per square kilometers are urban.
Therefore, (a), (c) and (d) can be discarded. (b) will be the right answer.

56 Biofortification refers to
a)  Breeding crops with higher levels of nutrition
b)  Enabling the plants to bear higher abiotic stresses
c)  Reducing the water requirement for the crops
d)  Increasing the physical strength of the plant
Answer: A
Biofortification - breeding crops with higher levels of vitamins and minerals, or higher protein and healthier fats - is the most practical means to improve public health.
Breeding for improved nutritional quality is undertaken with the objectives of improving: (i) Protein content and quality; (ii) Oil content and quality; (iii) Vitamin content; and (iv) Micronutrient and mineral content.
The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi has also released several vegetable crops that are rich in vitamins and minerals, e.g., vitamin A enriched carrots, spinach, pumpkin; vitamin C enriched bitter gourd, bathua, mustard, tomato; iron and calcium enriched spinach and bathua; and protein enriched beans - broad, lablab, French and garden peas.

57 Which of the following may be a valid reason for artistic and respectful representations of many snakes in traditional paintings like Gondi?
a)  Snakes were considered a spiritual symbol and showed man in harmony with nature.
b)  The paintings were used to create awareness about vituperous snakes.
c)  Snakes were killed on a large scale in several rituals and festivals which were depicted in the traditional paintings.
d)  Snakes were painted to get divine blessings before major warfare.
Answer: A
In ancient traditions as well as modern times, snakes are symbols of healing powers and opportunities.
The snake animal meaning is powerfully connected to life force and primal energy. In many cultures, it is revered as a powerful totem representing the source of life.
In the Hindu regions of Asia the serpent or naga is considered a nature spirit. It is the protector of springs, wells and rivers. Serpents bring rain and thus fertility. But, they can also bring floods and drought.
The Hindus believe that how the naga treats humanity is representative how we treat the snake and its environment. Serpents also carry the elixir of life and immortality.

58 The practice of 'transhumance' refers to
a)  Seasonal migration in between plains and mountains in search for pasture
b)  Adjusting livestock in the field according to the carrying capacity of the pastureland
c)  Rearing of animals on mountain ranges based on scientific practices
d)  Import and export of cattle by local community for improving pastureland
Answer: A
Movement in search of pastures is undertaken either over vast horizontal distances or vertically from one elevation to another in the mountainous regions.
The process of migration from plain areas to pastures on mountains during summers and again from mountain pastures to plain areas during winters is known as transhumance.
In mountain regions, such as Himalayas, Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis and Bhotiyas migrate from plains to the mountains in summers and to the plains from the high altitude pastures in winters.
Similarly, in the tundra regions, the nomadic herders move from south to north in summers and from north to south in winters.

59 Proportion of literate population of a country known as literacy in an indicator of its socio-economic development. Literacy in India will necessarily increase if
a)  Total years of schooling for the entire population increase
b)  Sanitation and health facilities are improved
c)  Economic growth rate is high
d)  More children pass the primary school in the country
Answer: D
Literacy is an indicator of a country's socio-economic development as it reveals the standard of living, social status of females, availability of educational facilities and policies of government.
Level of economic development (and not just economic growth) is both a cause and consequence of literacy. So, option (c) is not satisfactory.
Total years of schooling may increase for the already literate population. So, (a) is not necessarily correct.
In India - literacy rate denotes the percentage of population above 7 years of age, who is able to read, write and have the ability to do arithmetic calculations with understanding.

60 The sewage water is treated untill the
a)  Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the sewage water increases significantly
b)  Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the sewage water increases significantly
c)  Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the sewage water is reduced significantly
d)  Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the sewage water is reduced significantly
Answer: D
Concept and BOD refers to the amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.
The BOD 
sample of water and thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.
The greater the BOD of waste water more is its polluting potential. So, (d) is correct.

61 Gross National Happiness (GNH) is Bhutan's measure of national progress. Which of the following indicators is/are common to both GNH and Human Development Index (HDI)?
1.  Sustainable 2.  Establishment of good governance
3.  Preservation and promotion of cultural values
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
LearningBhutan is the only country in the world to officially proclaim the Gross
National Happiness (GNH) as the measure of the country's progress.
Material progress and technological developments are approached more cautiously taking into consideration the possible harm they might bring to the environment or the other aspects of cultural and spiritual life of the Bhutanese.
This simply means material progress cannot come at the cost of happiness. GNH encourages us to think of the spiritual, non-material and qualitative aspects of development.
HDI merely consists of education index, longevity index and income index.

62 Ganga Action Plan (GAP) and Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) were initiated before the
Namami Ganga programme. GAP and YAP were initiated by the
a)  Ministry of Environment and Forests
b)  Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation
c)  Ministry of Planning
d)  Ministry of Culture
Answer: A
The Ganga Action Plan or GAP was a program launched in 1985 to
reduce the pollution load on the river. But the efforts to decrease the pollution level in the river were unsuccessful even after spending nearly 1 billion rupees.
In 2014-15 annual budget, the FM announced an integrated Ganga development project titled 'Namami Ganga'.
As a part of the program, government of India ordered the shut down of 48 industrial units around Ganga.
The program has a budget outlay of Rs. 20,000 crore for the next 5 years.
'Namami Gange' will focus on pollution abatement interventions namely Interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater flowing through the open drains through bio-remediation / appropriate in-situ treatment / use of innovative technologies / sewage treatment plants (STPs) / effluent treatment plant (ETPs); rehabilitation and augmentation of existing STPs and
immediate short term measures for arresting pollution at exit points on river front to prevent inflow of sewage etc.
Significantly the approach is underpinned by socio-economic benefits that the program is expected to deliver in terms of job creation, improved livelihoods and health benefits to the vast population that is dependent on the river.

63 Which of the following terms connote the opposite meaning of the term "Population aging"?
a)  Sub-replacement fertility
b)  Pensions crisis
c)  Demographic trap
d)  Demographic Dividend
Answer: D
 Population ageing is the process by which the share of the older population becomes proportionally larger.
Sub-replacement fertility is a total fertility rate (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new generation being less populous than the previous one in a given area. So, (a) is wrong.
Demographic trap is combination of high fertility (birth rates) and declining mortality (death rates) in developing countries, resulting in a period of high population growth rate (PGR). But, not majority of people may be in the working age group. So, (c) is not appropriate.
Demographic dividend, as defined by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPa) means, "the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population's age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population (15 to 64) is larger than the non-working-age share of the population (14 and younger, and 65
and older).

64 Which of these can be used as a bio-pesticide?
1.  Bacteria
2.  Viruses
3.  Fungi
4.  Insects
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
An example of microbial biocontrol agents that can be introduced in order to control butterfly caterpillars is the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis. So, 1 is correct.
Microbial pesticides also include viruses for e.g. entomopathogenic fungi or viruses. So, 2 is correct.
A biological control being developed for use in the treatment of plant disease is the fungus Trichoderma. Trichoderma pecies are free-living fungi that are very common in the root ecosystems. They are effective biocontrol agents of several plant pathogens. So, 3 is correct.
The very familiar beetle with red and black markings – the Ladybird, and
Dragonflies are useful to get rid of aphids and mosquitoes, respectively. So, 4 is also
correct.

65 China started being influenced by Indian culture from 1st A.D due to which of the following?
1.  Land route passing through Central Asia
2.  Sea route through Burma (Myanmar) Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Buddhism reached China in the beginning of the first century A.D. A
number of Chinese pilgrims like Fahien and Hiuen Tsang visited India.
On the other side, hundreds of Buddhist monks like Gunabhadra, Vajrabothi, Dharmadeva and Dharmagupta visited China. Indian scholars translated many Sanskrit works at the request of Chinese emperors.
This contact with China continued even in the thirteenth century when the Mongols established their empire in China. Chinese art had also been influenced by Indian art.

66 Genetic modification techniques offer which of the following advantage(s) as compared to the traditional hybridisation technique?
1.  Genetic modification technique may not lead to inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes along with the desired genes.
2.  Genetic modification technique gives precise and quicker results unlike the traditional technique.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Asexual reproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction permits variation.
Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and animal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes along with the desired genes.
The techniques of genetic engineering which include creation of recombinant DNA, use of gene cloning and gene transfer, overcome this limitation and allows us to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into the target organism.
So, both 1 and 2 are correct.

a)  Long vertical paper scroll used to tell stories from religious epics
b)  Devotional stanzas by ancient poets inscribed on rocks
c)  Inner wall decoration of elite tribal homes
d)  Expression of prevention of child mortality by showing how elephants and other animals protect their young ones
Answer: A
The artists compose songs that they sing while they slowly unroll each scene of the painting.
Old fabric is pasted on the back of the scroll to make it stronger. These village storytellers travelled from village to village listening to news and passing on information much like television today.
The Gujarat earthquake of 2001 and the tsumani of 2004 inspired such singer-artists to present ballads of these natural disasters.

69 X is one of the neurotransmitters that play a role in mood changes. If the level of X is low for some reason, then the signal-sending activity becomes low, and the person suffers from depression. 'X' here may refer to
a)  Seldane
b)  Rantidine
c)  Noradrenaline
d)  Acetylcholine
Answer: C
Three brain chemicals -- noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine -- are involved in both brain and bodily functions.
Noradrenaline and serotonin have been consistently linked to psychiatric mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder.
Dopamine is commonly linked with the pleasure system of the brain. Disruption to the dopamine system is connected to psychosis and schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by distortions in reality and illogical thought patterns and behaviors.
The brain chemical serotonin is connected to many body functions such as sleep, wakefulness, eating, sexual activity, impulsivity, learning, and memory.
Researchers believe that abnormal functioning of brain circuits that involve serotonin as a chemical messenger contribute to mood disorders

70 Many freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and many sea water animals also cannot live for long in freshwater. Which of these can be a possible factor?
a)  Osmosis across body membrane of the fish may kill it.
b)  Sea water is heavier and crushes the skin of the freshwater fish, whereas freshwater makes sea water fish skin succulent
c)  Level of dissolved oxygen varies causing respiration problems.
d)  The dissolved nutrients in water are a major factor in determining the longevity of the fish.
Answer: A
 If a freshwater fish is put in salt water, the salty sea water would absorb the water from the fish via its gills due to osmosis until it dies.
The opposite happens to a saltwater fish placed in fresh water. It instead absorbs too much freshwater through its gills due to reverse osmosis and dies as a result.
Some fish can live in both fresh and salt water (salmon, eels, bull sharks for instance) but they require time to adjust between the two.

71 Which of the following canal connects the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific
Ocean in the west?
a)  Suez Canal
b)  Panama Canal
c)  Hormuz Canal
d)  Vistok Canal
Answer: B
It shortens the distance between New York and San Francisco by 13,000 km by sea.
Likewise the distance between Western Europe and the West-coast of U.S.A.; and
North-eastern and Central U.S.A. and East and South-east Asia is shortened.
The economic significance of this Canal is relatively less than that of the Suez. However, it is vital to the economies of Latin America.

72 Consider these matches of popular musical instruments with the region they belong to.
1.  Pakhawaj : North-Eastern India
2.  Maddalam : Southern India
3.  Thumbak nari : Northern India
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
Statement 1: The most well-known northern Indian double skin drum that is used especially for accompanying the old northern Indian Dhrupad style, is the Pakhawaj (simlar to the Mridangam in southern India).
Statement 2: It is a drum made out of the wood of the jackfruit tree. It has two sides for playing, made out of leather, and has different kind of sounds on each side. The maddalam is a heavy instrument which is hung around the waist of the person playing, and the player stands all the while to perform.
The maddalam is a vital instrument in traditional Kerala percussion ensembles like
Panchavadyam, Keli and Kathakali orchestra.
Statement 3: Keekli is a dance in the rajouri district of J&K. The main instruments played with these folk songs and folk dances are algoza, Dokra, Sarnai, Glass, Thumbak Nari, Sargi, flute, Dholak and Dhol etc.

73 Which of the following problems may be caused due to use of detergents?
1.  Bacteria may not be able to degrade them.
2.  These persist in water even after sewage treatment and cause foaming in rivers.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: Main problem that appears in the use of detergents is that if their hydrocarbon chain is highly branched, then bacteria cannot degrade this easily. Slow degradation of detergents leads to their accumulation. So, 1 is correct.
Therefore detergents with straight chain of hydrocarbons are preferred over branched chain as the latter are non-biodegradable and consequently cause environmental pollution.
Statement 2: Effluents containing such detergents reach the rivers, ponds, etc. These persist in water even after sewage treatment and cause foaming in rivers, ponds and streams and their water gets polluted.
These days the branching of the hydrocarbon chain is controlled and kept to the minimum. Unbranched chains can be biodegraded more easily and hence pollution is prevented.

74 Interspecific interactions can have many outcomes. Which of the following is an example of 'mutualism' interaction?
a)  Bees sucking nectar from flowers and helping them in pollination
b)  An orchid growing on top of a mango branch
c)  Mosquitoes sucking blood from its prey and infecting it with vector-borne diseases
d)  Competition between tigers and lions for prey in African forests
Answer: A
Concept:Both the species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in their interactions with each other. In both parasitism and predation, only one species benefits (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction is detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively).
The interaction where one species is benefitted and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed is called commensalism.
In amensalism on the other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common characteristic– the interacting species live closely together.
Option (b) is commenalism where one species derives benefit from the other, while the other does not. Mango tree supports orchid, but orchid does not
given any visible benefit to the mango tree. Option (c) is similar to parasitism.
Option (d) is the 'Competition' nature of interaction.

75 Aihole is known as the Cradle of Indian architecture. The Aihole inscription was issued

The inscription written in Sanskrit and it is in Kannada script. There is a mention about the defeat of Harshavardhana by Pulikeshi II.
And there is a mention about the victory of Chalukyas on Pallavas, also mentioned about the shifting of the capital from Aihole to Badami by Pulikeshi. There is mention about the poet Kalidasa.
The Aihole inscription issued by Pulakeshin II gives the details of his reign.

76 A small increase in population is desirable in a growing economy. This is because
a)  Lower population growth shows higher levels of economic development.
b)  A growing economy requires growing labour force.
c)  Human capital builds natural capital.
d)  Higher increase in population leads to loss of human capital.
Answer: B
Lower population growth may not necessarily show higher levels of economic development. It can be due to high death rate too. So, (a) is incorrect.
Option (c) is an incorrect statement. Natural capital exists in the nature, e.g. forests, lakes, land etc.
Option (d) is not appropriate, as higher increase in population may reduce per capita human capital, and not total human capital.

77 Under the reign of Rashtrakutas
1.  The village administration was carried on by the village headmen.
2.  Officers administering districts or subdivisions were directly appointed by the central government.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 
The Rashtrakuta Empire was divided into several provinces called rashtras under the control of rashtrapatis. They were further divided into vishayas or districts governed by vishayapatis. The next subdivision was bhukti consisting of 50 to 70 villages under the control of bhogapatis. These officers were directly appointed by the
central government. So, 1 is correct.
The village administration was carried on by the village headmen. However, the village assemblies played a significant role in the village administration. So, 2 is correct.

78 Consider the following statements. Assertion (a): The Northern Atlantic Sea Route is one of the busiest in the world. Reason (R): It is only route with natural harbours amongst all trade routes.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R can be an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R cannot be an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: C
Many other routes have natural harbours, for e.g Pacific route. So, R is incorrect.
The North Atlantic sea route links North-eastern U.S.A. and Northwestern Europe, the two industrially developed regions of the world.
The foreign trade over this route is greater than that of the rest of the world combined. One fourth of the world's foreign trade moves on this route.
It is, therefore, the busiest in the world and otherwise, called the Big Trunk Route. Both the coasts have highly advanced ports and harbour facilities.
This sea route passes through the heart of the Old World and serves more countries and people than any other route. Port Said, Aden, Mumbai, Colombo and Singapore are some of the important ports on this route.

79 Consider the following about bioreactors.
1.  It can support both aerobic and anaerobic processes.
2.  It can be used to grow cells or tissues.
3.  Bioreactors must be left open to allow biological reactions to take place.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 A bioreactor may refer to any manufactured or engineered device or system that supports a biologically active environment. This process can either be aerobic or anaerobic. So, 1 is correct.
A bioreactor may also refer to a device or system meant to grow cells or tissues in the context of cell culture. These devices are being developed for use in tissue
engineering or biochemical engineering. So, 2 is correct.
A photobioreactor (PBR) is a bioreactor which incorporates some type of light source. Virtually any translucent container could be called a PBR, however the term is more commonly used to define a closed system, as opposed to an open tank or pond. Photobioreactors are used to grow small phototrophic organisms such as cyanobacteria, algae, or moss plants. So, 3 is correct.

80 Consider the following statements about Cyanobacteria.
1.  They are found only in aquatic environments.
2.  They can serve as a biofertiliser in paddy fields.
3.  They add organic matter to the soil and increase its fertility.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic and terrestrial environments many of which can fix atmospheric nitrogen. So, 1 is incorrect.
Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, etc are important cynaobacteria. In paddy fields, cyanobacteria serve as an important biofertiliser. Blue green algae also add organic matter to the soil and increase its fertility. So, 2 and 3 are correct.
Currently, in our country, a number of biofertilisers are available commercially in the market and farmers use these regularly in their fields to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce dependence on chemical fertilisers.

81 One of your office colleagues is suffering from severe irritation and pain due to acidity in the stomach. You would recommend Antacids to her because
a)  It cures Ulcer which may be the cause of irritation and pain
b)  It reduces formation of peptacides and bile juice in the stomach
c)  It reduces the pH of the stomach which relieves the pain
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Antacids only treat the symptoms of the diseases like Ulcer, not their cause. So, (a) is wrong.
Bile is a digestive juice that is secreted by the liver (not stomach) and stored in the gallbladder. So, (b) would be wrong.
Lower pH means acidity of the stomach is increased, so (c) can't be the answer.
 An antacid is a substance which neutralizes stomach acidity, which in turn relieves heartburn.
Antacids are available over the counter and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional heartburn, the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms.

82 In his reign, the introduction of paying salaries in cash to the soldiers led to price regulations popularly called as Market Reforms. He was the first Sultan of Delhi who ordered for the measurement of land. His land revenue reforms provided a basis for the future reforms of Sher Shah and Akbar. He is?
a)  Alauddin Khalji
b)  Ghazi Malik
c)  Balban
d)  Iltutmish
Answer: A
Market reforms:
Alauddin Khalji established four separate markets in Delhi, one for grain;
another for cloth, sugar, dried fruits, butter and oil; a third for horses, slaves and cattle; and a fourth for miscellaneous commodities.
Each market was under the control of a high officer called Shahna-i-Mandi. The supply of grain was ensured by holding stocks in government store- houses. Regulations were issued to fix the price of all commodities.
Land reforms:
Apart from market reforms, Alauddin Khalji took important steps in the land revenue administration.
He was the first Sultan of Delhi who ordered for the measurement of land. Even the big landlords could not escape from paying land tax.
Land revenue was collected in cash in order to enable the Sultan to pay the soldiers in cash. His land revenue reforms provided a basis for the future reforms of Sher Shah and Akbar.

a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Temperature is one of the most important ecologically relevant factors.
For e.g. mango trees do not and cannot grow in temperate countries like Canada and
Germany where temperatures are low. So, 1 is incorrect.
Tuna fish are rarely caught beyond tropical latitudes in the ocean. So, 2 would be incorrect.
Snow leopards are found in very cold climates, for e.g. in northwestern Himalayas.
So, 3 would be incorrect.

84 A department called Diwan-i-Khairat was created under the reign of Firoz Tughlaq to
a)  Consolidate decentralized treasuries across the empire
b)  Take care of orphans and widows
c)  Address public grievances and complaints against officials
d)  Take care of religious tourists and travellers
Answer: B
 Diwan-i-Khairat was created to take care of orphans and widows. Free hospitals and marriage bureaus for poor Muslims were also established by Firoz.
However he increased the number of slaves by capturing the defeated soldiers and young persons. In his regime the number of slaves had increased to one lakh eighty thousand.
When Firoz died in 1388 the struggle for power between the Sultan and the nobles started once again. His successors had to face the rebellion of the slaves created by Firoz.

85 Which of the following is/are artificial sweeteners?
1.  Alitame
2.  Sucrolose
3.  Saccharin
4.  Lactamase
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 4 only
b)  1, 2 and 3 only
c)  3 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: B
 Ortho-sulphobenzimide, also called saccharin, is the first popular artificial sweetening agent. It has been used as a sweetening agent ever since it was discovered in 1879. It is about 550 times as sweet as cane sugar. It is excreted from the body in urine unchanged.
Alitame is high potency sweetener, although it is more stable than aspartame, the control of sweetness of food is difficult while using it.
Sucrolose is trichloro derivative of sucrose. Its appearance and taste are like sugar. It is stable at cooking temperature. It does not provide calories.

86 Consider the following about beliefs of Sufis.
1.  Love and devotion is a means of attaining salvation.
2.  One must have the guidance of a master without which spiritual development is impossible.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: Sufism stressed the elements of love and devotion as effective means of the realisation of God. Love of God meant love of humanity and so the Sufis believed service to humanity was tantamount to service to God. While orthodox Muslims emphasise external conduct, the Sufis lay stress on inner purity.
Statement 2: According to them one must have the guidance of a pir or guru, without which spiritual development is impossible. This is because the path of devotion can be very tough for a novice follower.
Sufism also inculcated a spirit of tolerance among its followers. Other ideas emphasised by Sufism are meditation, good actions, repentance for sins,
performance of prayers and pilgrimages, fasting, charity and suppression of passions by ascetic practices.

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Demographic transition theory can be used to describe and predict the future population of any area.
The theory tells us that population of any region changes from high births and high deaths to low births and low deaths as society progresses from rural agrarian and illiterate to urban industrial and literate society.
These changes occur in stages which are collectively known as the demographic cycle. So, both 1 and 2 are incorrect.

91 Consider the following about the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).

92 The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has recently re-defined terms that are not scientifically precise in weather forecasting. As per the new definitions, a "Large Deficient year" for rainfall refers to
a)  Metrological drought in at least a majority of states of India
b)  Rainfall deficit of over 10 per cent across more than 40 per cent of India's area
c)  Rainfall less than half of the average annual precipitation over India as a whole
d)  Hydrological drought in major basins of India where rainfall is less than the
average annual precipitation
Answer: B
 The IMD has never used the term "drought" in its forecasts and has maintained that declaring droughts was the prerogative of States.
The agency had several definitions of drought: meteorological, hydrological and agricultural, and it was quite possible for a State to have a meteorological drought-
90 per cent shortfall of the average monsoon rainfall Ñ but not suffer an agricultural drought Ñif the shortfall didn't affect more than 20 per cent of the State's area.
Refer to the image below (or in the Q source) for the new definitions.

95 The President has promulgated the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2016 to make amendments to the Enemy Property Act, 1968. Which of the following agreements is relevant to these existing laws?
a)  Tashkent Declaration (1966)
b)  Panchsheel Declaration– India and China
c)  Simla Agreement (1971)
d)  Simla Accord (1914)
Answer: A
  In the wake of the two India-Pakistan wars in 1965 and
1971, there was migration of people from India to Pakistan.
The properties and companies of such migrated persons (acquired Pakistani
nationality) were confiscated by Union Government under the Defence of
India Rules framed under Defence of India Act.
These enemy properties were vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property for
India by the Union Government.
In the Tashkent Declaration (signed in 1966), a clause was included to discuss the return of the assets and
property taken over by either side in connection with the conflict. However, Pakistan Government had disposed of all such enemy properties in their country in
1971.
Enemy Property Act, 1968: provided for the continuous vesting of enemy property in the custodian. The possession of enemy properties spread across many states in the country vest with the Union Government through the Custodian of Enemy Property for India.
The recent ordinance bridges the gaps in the earlier laws to ensure that the enemy properties that have been vested in the Custodian remain so and they do not revert back to the enemy subject or enemy firm.

96 The Rate of Natural Increase (RNI) of population includes
1.  Immigration
2.  Death rates
3.  Emigration
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: C
 In demographics, the rate of natural increase (RNI) is the crude birth rate minus the crude death rate of a population.
Immigration and emigration are counted when total population growth rate is calculated.
For e.g. in metropolitan cities in India out of a total growth of 100, nearly 44 comes from natural increase, and not migration.

97 Consider the following about regional trading blocs.
1.  A trading bloc can only be formed when all tariff and non-tariff restrictions are removed between members.

a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
A trading bloc can be formed by simply lowering the barriers for members and keeping it intact for non-members. So, 1 is incorrect.
It is an economic union that adopts common economic policies. This issue has been dealt in detail in another question on "Free Trade area and Customs Union" in the 

98 The Union Government has abolished export duty on iron ore pellets in order to make the commodity more competitive amid weakening prices.What factor(s) can be said responsible behind the weakening of prices?
1.  Global economic slowdown has caused slackening of demand and thus prices
2.  Subdued demand for steel and related raw materials in USA which is world's largest metal consumer
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Due to global economic slowdown and decrease in demand followed by increase in supply (production) has attributed to decrease in global commodity prices especially minerals and oil. So, 1 is correct.
Moreover, steel and its related raw material market is also facing a tough time on account of subdued demand and high production which in turn is adversely impacting the prices.
However, China and not USA is the world's largest metal consumer. So, 2 would be wrong. It is the fall in demand in China that has subdued overall demand and prices.

The Empire was divided into different administrative units called Mandalams, Nadus, sthalas and finally into gramas. The governor of Mandalam was called Mandaleswara or Nayak. ijayanagar rulers gave full powers to the local authorities in the administration.
