a)  Namcha Barwa Ranges

The Arakan Mountains divide the Rakhine coast from the rest of Burma, and thus have acted as a barrier between the peoples of central Burma and those of the Indian subcontinent.
The Arakan Mountains act as a barrier to the south-western monsoon rains and thus shield the central Myanmar area, making their western slopes extraordinarily wet during the monsoon.

9 In the Indian National Saka Calendar, the months in the first half of the year all have 31 days to take into account
a)  Change of seasons
b)  Slower movement of the sun across the ecliptic
c)  Old traditions and festivals
d)  Orbital velocity of the Moon
Answer: B
 The ecliptic is the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial sphere. It is coplanar (same plane) with the orbit of Earth around the Sun.
The Sun seems to move against the background stars as seen from the orbiting
Earth. The ecliptic is the path the Sun appears to trace through the stars.
Because Earth takes one year to orbit the Sun, the apparent position of the Sun also takes the same length of time to make a complete circuit of the ecliptic.
But, the actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so the speed with which the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. This is taken into account by the Saka Calendar and the first six months are adjusted for the apparent slow movement of the Sun in the ecliptic.

Storage, transportation, distribution, hoarding are the other aspects of price management of this category.
Statement 2: For e.g. Cost of energy (electricity) has effectively come down due to introduction of LED bulbs. Any possible inflation in energy prices are also taken care by the low power consumption and electricity bills due to LEDs.

This is a short-term measure. In the long-run, the best way is to increase production with the help of the best production practices.

 If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in the national interest that Parliament should make laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliament becomes competent to make laws on that matter. This cannot be declared by the President, Lok Sabha or the National Security Council. So, all statements except 3 are wrong.
The Parliament can make laws on any matter in the State List for implementing the international treaties, agreements or conventions.

68 Consider the following statements about United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations.
1.  UN maintains an independent peacekeeping army funded by contributions from member states.
2.  UN Security Council authorizes peacekeeping operations.
3.  Regional organizations can be authorized to undertake peacekeeping operations.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: B
Statement 1 and 3 : Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself, with troops serving under UN operational control.
In these cases, peacekeepers remain members of their respective armed forces, and do not constitute an independent "UN army," as the UN does not have such a force.
In cases where direct UN involvement is not considered appropriate or feasible, the Council authorizes regional organizations such as the NATO or coalitions of willing countries to undertake peacekeeping or peace- enforcement tasks.
Statement 2: The UN Charter gives the UNSC the power and responsibility to take collective action to maintain international peace and security. For this reason, the international community usually looks to the UNSC to authorize peacekeeping operations through Chapter VI authorizations.

b)  Grants made for any public purpose by the Centre to the States
c)  Temporary grants given by the Centre to the states which the states must repay in due time

a)  Cabinet gives a written recommendation to the President
b)  The Parliament passes a resolution by simple majority to this effect
c)  The President is individually satisfied that it is in the best national interest
d)  The National Security Council recommends it to the President
Answer: A
The emergency can be declared only on the concurrence of the cabinet and not merely even on the advice of the prime minister or Home Minister.
The proclamation of Emergency should be approved by both the Houses of
Parliament within one month from the date of its issue. So, (b) is wrong.
In 1975, the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi advised the president to proclaim emergency without consulting her cabinet.
The cabinet was informed of the proclamation after it was made, as a fait accompli.

List.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
Statement 1: The Centre becomes entitled to give executive directions to a state on 'any' matter. Thus, the state governments are brought under the complete control of the Centre, though they are not suspended.
Statement 2: Although the legislative power of a state legislature is not suspended, it becomes subject to the overriding power of the Parliament.
Thus, the normal distribution of the legislative powers between the Centre and states is suspended, though the state legislatures are not suspended. In brief, the Constitution becomes unitary rather than federal.

87 A constitutional amendment bill that amends major federal features can be passed by
a)  Special majority in each house of the Parliament
b)  Absolute Majority in any one house of the Parliament
c)  Simple majority in both house of Parliament as well as in majority of State

Answer: D
Ordinarily, the bill must be passed in each House by a special majority, that is, a majority (that is, more than 50 per cent) of the total membership of the House and a majority of two-thirds of the members of the House present and voting.
Each House must pass the bill separately. In case of a disagreement between the two Houses, there is no provision for holding a joint sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of deliberation and passage of the bill.
If the bill seeks to amend the federal provisions of the Constitution, it must also be ratified by the legislatures of half of the states by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of the House present and voting. So, (d) is the only correct answer.

inflation in India is 5000%, then the very next year the value of Rs. 5000 in year
2015 will be near Rs. 100 in year 2016. It also leads to depreciation in the exchange rate of the currency.
As a result, people lose confidence in the currency and holding it becomes a risky proposition. So, people switch to other forms of wealth like Gold, Foreign Currency (also known as "inflation proof" assets) etc.
It is one of the important reasons for the recent Gold rush in India. Introducing inflation-indexed bonds, Gold bonds is one way of reducing the demand of unproductive physical assets.
