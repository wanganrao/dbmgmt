1 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): Africa does not have coal reserves.
2.  Reason (R): African landscape is composed entirely of sedimentary and crystalline rocks.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: D
 South Africa and Zimbabwe are the only two African countries recognised by the IEA as having proven coal reserves.
Nigeria is also believed to have abundant coal reserves left unexploited
Entire African landscape is not covered with sedimentary or crystalline rocks. The presence of many volcanoes clearly indicates that there are igneous rocks. Moreover, oil reserves are plenty in Africa. So, R is incorrect.

2 The Government of India (GoI) Act of 1935 provided for a three-fold emumenration,
viz., federal, provincial and concurrent. The present Constitution follows the scheme of this act but with some difference(s), which are
1.  In the GoI Act 1935, residuary powers were given to the governor-general of India, which now vests with the Centre
2.  In the GoI Act 1935, Centre had no right to legislate in the concurrent list without the consent from the concerned state.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 The present Constitution follows the scheme of this act but with one
User Name :      Kant
difference, that is, under this 1935 act, the residuary powers were given neither to
the federal legislature nor to the provincial legislature but to the governor-general of
India.
As of now, it vests with the Centre.
The provision with regard to concurrent list was same as earlier. So, 2 is incorrect.

3 Once a language is declared as a classical language by the Government of India (GoI), what are the advantages conferred to it?
1.  It must be taught in all Centre-funded Universities
2.  The speakers of the language are given preference in government jobs
3.  The GoI gives financial assistance for setting up a centre of excellence for the study of that language.
4.  The GoI sets up dedicated missions to promote that language abroad
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  3 and 4 only
Answer: B
  The criteria for declaring a language as classical mandates high antiquity of its early texts/recorded history over a period of
1,500-2,000 years, a body of ancient literature/texts which is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers and a literary tradition that is original and not borrowed from another speech community.
Once a language is declared classical, it gets financial assistance for setting up a centre of excellence for the study of that language and also opens up an avenue for two major awards for scholars of eminence.
Besides, the University Grants Commission can be requested to create û to begin with at least in Central Universities û a certain number of professional chairs for classical languages for scholars of eminence in the language.

5 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): In the North Indian Ocean, there is a complete reversal of the
User Name :      Kant
direction of ocean currents between summer and winter.
2.  Reason (R): Monsoon winds change direction from South-west to North-east
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is incorrect
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: A
 The currents of the Indian Ocean are modified by the landmass in the north and influenced by the Monsoon winds.
In the North Indian Ocean, a complete reversal of direction of Monsoon Current, twice a year is observed between summer and winter because the Monsoon winds change their direction according to seasons.
South-West Monsoon Current(warm) o In the summer season, the monsoon winds blow from south west to north-east. Consequently, the ocean current also flows from south-west to north-east direction. o The main current moves in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal along the coast of India.
North-East Monsoon Current (warm) o In the winter season, the monsoon winds blow from north-east to south-west. The ocean current also flows from north-east to south-west under the influence of these winds.

6 The Election Commission registers political parties for the purpose of elections and grants them recognition as national or state parties on the basis of their
a)  Membership size
b)  Regional Presence
c)  Poll performance
d)  Party exchequer
Answer: C
 The other parties that are not recognized by the ECI are simply declared as registered-unrecognised parties.
User Name :      Kant
The recognition granted by the Commission to the parties determines their right to certain privileges like allocation of the party symbols, provision of time for political broadcasts on the state-owned television and radio stations and access to electoral rolls.

7 Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most serious air pollutants. It is released in air by
1.  Automobile exhaust
2.  Volcanic activity
3.  Forest and bushfires
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 It is produced as a result of incomplete combustion of carbon. Carbon monoxide is mainly released into the air by automobile exhaust. Other sources, which produce CO, involve incomplete combustion of coal, firewood, petrol, etc.
Carbon monoxide is present in small amounts in the atmosphere, chiefly as a
product of volcanic activity but also from natural and man-made fires (such as forest and bushfires, burning of crop residues, and sugarcane fire-cleaning).

8 Estuaries are one of the most biologically productive regions in the World because
a)  It receives high amount of nutrients from both fresh and marine water.
b)  It witnesses high wave action
c)  It is not subject to tidal fluctuations unlike the open sea
d)  Warm and cold currents meet at estuaries.
Answer: A
  Estuaries are unique places, strongly affected by tidal
User Name :      Kant
action, where land and river and sea merge into a dynamic natural complex. But, there is little wave action unlike the open sea. So, (b) and (c) are incorrect.
Estuaries rank along with tropical rainforests and coral reefs as the world's most productive ecosystems, more productive than both the rivers and the ocean that influence them from either side.
In an estuary, nutrient-rich river waters combine with warmer, light infused shallow coastal waters and the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean waters to generate primary productivity
The mixing of lighter fresh water and heavier salt water trap and circulate nutrients such that they are often retained and recycled by benthic (bottom dwelling) organisms to create a self-enriching system.

12 Which of the following schedules of the constitution gives a clear constitutional recognition to the existence of the system of "political parties" in India?
a)  Seventh Schedule
b)  Tenth Schedule
c)  Third Schedule
d)  Ninth Schedule
Answer: B
  The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution (which embodies the anti-defection law) is designed to prevent the evil or mischief of political defections motivated by the lure of office or material benefits or other similar considerations
Since the anti-defection provisions clearly mention the existence of political parties (and members being disqualified on leaving its membership), the Tenth schedule recognizes the system of political parties.

13 Fly ash is one of the coal combustion products. Use of fly ash in agriculture can
1.  Increase crop yield
2.  Increase concentrations of arsenic in crops
3.  Enhances water holding capacity of land
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
User Name :      Kant
Answer: D
 Statement 1 and 3: Fly ash can be used as a soil ameliorate that may improve physical, chemical and biological properties of the degraded soils and is a source of readily available plant micro-and macro-nutrients. The high concentration of elements (K, Na, Zn, Ca, Mg and Fe) in fly-ash increases the yield of many agricultural crops.
Statement 2: However, fly ash contains various amounts of toxic metals. And studies have shown that food crops grown in large amounts can soak up hazardous concentrations of arsenic.

14 India followed the policy of Non-Alignment post-independence in response to
a)  Economic backwardness of India
b)  Impending wars with South Asian neighbours
c)  Cold war rivalry
d)  Former agreements between South Asian neighbours
Answer: C
 A case can be made for options (a) and (b), but these are not as strong as option (c), which is the most appropriate option.
Option (a) because, policy of non-alignment helped us maintain an independent foreign policy and stop neo-colonialism, which could have again sapped IndiaÆs resouces
Option (b) because joining a cold war alliance may have further aggravated rivalry with neighbours
But, (c) is most appropriate as it was the cold war and in this context, Jawaharlal Nehru observed: ôWe propose to keep away from the power politics of groups, aligned against one another, which have led in the past to world wars and which may again lead to disasters on an even vaster scale.

a)  It can be traded on an open market.
b)  It is a peer-to-peer digital currency
c)  It does not require any intermediary like a bank for transaction
d)  It can only be used for speculation and not for any purchase
Answer: D
 Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is unregulated by any central bank or government, but still works for purchasing goods and services from retailers willing to accept it. So, (d) is correct
It can also be traded on an open market and its exchange rate fluctuates much like a stock market i.e. based on the demand.
Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without the inter- mediation of any central authority
Bitcoin is also called a ôcryptocurrencyö since it is decentralized and uses cryptography to prevent double-spending, a significant challenge inherent to digital currencies.

2.  The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of independent nations
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
User Name :      Kant
 Statement 1: Under the formula of the London Declaration, Queen
Elizabeth II is the Head of the Commonwealth. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: Being a member of commonwealth also does not affect IndiaÆs republican character as India neither pays final allegiance to the British Crown nor the latter has any functions to discharge in relation to India since it is a voluntary organization.

17 Generally fogs are more common over sea than land. Which of the following can be the reason(s)?
1.  Ocean salt provides condensation nuclei for the formation of fog.
2.  Moist air blown by wind over a cool surface will form fog.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: Sea fog forms when the condensation nuclei is salt. Salt is, of course, very common near the ocean where it is kicked up into the atmosphere by the breaking waves. Salt is a unique condensation nuclei in that it will allow fog to form when the humidity is as low as 70%.
Statement 2: When wind blows moist air over a cool surface the air will cool and advection fog will form. Advection fog is very common at sea when tropical winds pass over cooler waters and on land when a warm front passes over heavy snow.

18 India has not signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 and the
Comprehensive

b)  The treaties were discriminatory and hegemonistic in nature in India's view
c)  The treaty demands sharing of crucial and strategic information of a nation's
User Name :      Kant
nuclear facilities.
d)  The treaty demands complete control of the concerned Nuclear authority of the nation
Answer: B
 By not signing the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 and the Comprehensive 
India opposses NPT and CTBT due to their discriminatory and hegemonistic nature. They perpetuate an international system in which only five nations (USA, Russia, China, UK and France) can legitimately possess nuclear weapons.
India is already sharing information regarding its nuclear facilities with IAEA. So, this could not have been a contention while signing the NPT and CTBT. (c) will be wrong thus.

20 Which of these is/are a part of the capital receipts of the Government of India?
1.  Borrowings from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
2.  Money accrued from sale of government bonds to the public
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 A receipt is a capital receipt if it satisfies any one of the two conditions:
(i) The receipts must create a liability for the government. For example, Borrowings are capital receipts as they lead to an increase in the liability of the government. However, tax received is not a capital receipt as it does not result in creation of any liability.
(ii) The receipts must cause a decrease in the assets. For example, receipts from sale of shares of public enterprise is a capital receipt as it leads to reduction in assets of the government
Since, both borrowing and sale of government bonds create liability, they are called capital receipts.

21 Consider the following statements

The Ministry at the Centre has been formed due to a variety of reasons (only some are listed below):
Agriculture is a strategic sector, and is vital for the livelihood for a majority of Indian population.
It is essential to coordinate and assist the activities of the states to achieve synergy and higher agriculture growth.
Floods, droughts, other disasters that occur on regional scale or national scale affect agriculture. CentreÆs intervention is important to stop this.
The centre needs to work for the welfare the farmer community which is so closely associated with Agriculture.
States may not be financially and technically capable to support and improve agriculture in the state.

23 Neem-coating of Urea is an important recent reform in the fertiliser sector. This has been done to
a)  Improve the shell life of Urea
b)  Reduce the toxic effects of the urea on crops
c)  Reduce the cost of nitrogen-based fertilizers
d)  Prevent diversion of urea to industrial uses
Answer: D
  Urea is an important supplier of nitrogen, which is necessary for the development of plants. But only 30-40 per cent of nitrogen present in the urea is utilised by crops
When farmers use conventional urea, about half the applied nitrogen is not assimilated by the plant and leaches into the soil, causing extensive groundwater contamination
Spraying urea with neem oil slows the release of nitrogen, by about 10 to 15 per cent, concomitantly reducing consumption of the fertiliser.
User Name :      Kant
The neem-coating also precludes an age-old malpractice of this cheap fertiliser being diverted for use in the chemical industry and, most harmfully in states like Punjab and Haryana, as an additive in milk to whiten it

a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
User Name :      Kant
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Primary producers, also called autotrophs, are organisms that can produce their own food.
In almost all cases these are photosynthetically active organisms.
Fungi and other organisms that gain their biomass from oxidizing organic materials are called decomposers and are not primary producers.
However, lichens located in tundra climates are an exceptional example of a primary producer that, by mutualistic symbiosis, combine photosynthesis by algae (or additionally nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria) with the protection of a decomposer fungus

of broad-leafed trees can be found. Which of the following is most similar to this
description?
a)  Tropical Deciduous forests
b)  Temperate Deciduous forests
c)  Tropical rainforests
d)  Mediterranean vegetation
Answer: C
 A rainforest has an almost constant year-round humidity. This is because a rainforest receives lots of rain and has a constantly warm temperature.
As a result of the consistent temperatures and humidity and the constant yearly rainfall, a rainforest only has two seasons. Tropical rainforests have a wet season and a dry season
A tropical rainforest has four distinct layers: the emergent layer (tallest trees), the canopy, the understorey and the forest floor.

In addition to providing corals with essential nutrients, zooxanthellae are responsible for the unique and beautiful colors of many stony corals.
Sometimes when corals become physically stressed, the polyps expel their algal cells and the colony takes on a stark white appearance. This is commonly described as "coral bleaching"

37 The Supreme Court has recently struck down the TRAI Regulation which made it mandatory for telecom companies to compensate subscribers for call drops. The TRAI order was nullified because
a)  Call drops do not violate consumer's freedom of expression
b)  TRAI cannot financially punish telecom companies
c)  It was against the Rule of law as enshrined in Article 14 of the constitution
d)  The SC found it to be unreasonable and arbitrary
Answer: D
 SC noted that the TRAI had no empirical evidence to corroborate that call drops were attributable to deficiency in services by the service providers.
It further said that the impugned regulation must be held to be manifestly arbitrary and an "unreasonable restriction on the telecom firms' fundamental rights to carry on business, and is therefore struck down as such."
Consumer may receive compensation for a call drop that may be attributable to the fault of the consumer himself.

40 Consider the following with regard to water pollution.
1.  Hot water discharged from industries lowers the dissolved oxygen in the water body.
2.  Oil spills at sea decrease the oxygen level in the water causing harm to organisms.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: The dissolved oxygen in water reduces with increasing temperature. So, the hotter the water, the lesser is the possibility of its holding oxygen and aquatic life.
Statement 2: Most of the oil spilled in the ocean does not decompose and remain in the ocean for years. It uses oxygen as it degrades.
As a result of this, oxygen levels go down. When oxygen levels go down, the chances of survival of marine animals also goes down.

52 The Puranas were written to illustrate and expound
a)  The rituals followed in ancient India
User Name :      Kant
b)  The truth of the Vedas
c)  The rationale behind the Hindu social structure
d)  The history of ancient Kingdoms in India
Answer: B
 The word Purana means 'that which renews the old' and is almost always mentioned alongwith Itihasa.
The fundamental abstruse philosophical and religious truths were expounded through popular legends or mythological stories.
If something is described as a story, it exerts a greater influence on the human mind.
Thus, Itihasa combined with narration makes a story seem credible.
Together with the two epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, they are the origins of many of the stories and anecdotes of the social, religious and cultural history of India.

74 Temperature inversion refers to the phenomenon where
User Name :      Kant
a)  Surface of the Earth is warmer than the air above it.
b)  Coastal areas witness higher temperatures than usual.
c)  Mountain valleys witness orographic rains without convection.
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Usually, within the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) the air near the surface of the Earth is warmer than the air above it, largely because the atmosphere is heated from below as solar radiation warms the Earth's surface, which in turn then warms the layer of the atmosphere directly above it.
Given the right conditions, the normal vertical temperature gradient is inverted such that the air is colder near the surface of the Earth. This can occur when, for example, a warmer, less-dense air mass moves over a cooler, denser air mass.
It can also happen in valleys are the cold air slides down the mountain slope and warm air moves up.

84 What will happen to a plant cell if it is kept in a solution having higher water potential?
a)  It will shrink in size.
b)  It will die due to the disintegration of the cell.
User Name :      Kant
c)  It will swell in size but may not burst.
d)  Nothing will happen to the plant cell.
Answer: C
A hypotonic solution has higher water potential. It has a lower osmotic pressure than another solution i.e. has less solute and more water than another solution
When a plant cell is placed in hypotonic solution, the cell gains water and thus gains turgor pressure.
This leads to the cell getting swollen. But the rigidity of the cell wall, prevents the cell from bursting.

86 The temperature of equatorial regions is moderated due to
a)  Cloudiness and heavy precipitation
b)  Katabatic winds
c)  North-easterly trade winds
d)  Cold ocean currents
Answer: A
Cloudiness and heavy precipitation around 150 – 250 cm of rainfall or more in a year, helps to moderate the temperature, so that even at the equator, climate is not unbearable.
Cloudiness reduces solar insolation, and precipitation lowers the temperature even from the consistent year long solar insolation that is received at the equator.

89 Miners use canaries to detect the presence of a deadly gas in underground mines which is
a)  Carbon monoxide
b)  Methane
c)  Hydrogen Sulphide
d)  Mine damp gas
Answer: A
 Miners collapse and often die even if small quantities of the highly poisonous CO are present in the air.
When lowered into mines with CO presence, the birds show distress symptoms such as ruffling of feathers, pronounced chirping and loss of life.
These reactions occur even if 0.15 per cent of CO is present in the air. If the content is 0.3 per cent the bird shows immediate distress and falls off its perch in two to three minutes.
A cage of birds is a good indicator in air containing more than 0.15 per cent CO.

a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  A is incorrect and R is correct.

The Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions, Jainism, Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. Buddhism too found support and was popular in places such as Dambal and Balligavi, although it had declined significantly by
this time.
Yet, the growth of all religions did not affect the progress of Jainism under the patronage of Rashtrakuta kings and officers. Almost one third of the population of the Deccan were Jains.
There were some prosperous Buddhist settlements at places like Kanheri, Sholapur and Dharwar.

91 Casual employment implies
a)  Self-employment
b)  Employment in the unorganized sector

95 The equatorial environment is best suited to plantation agriculture due to the presence of
a)  Good rainfall, humid climate, cheap labour and good markets in Europe and
North America
b)  Hot climate and absence of disease causing pests that reduce plantation yield
c)  Acidic soil and dry weather for most of season that supports the growth of plantation crops especially dry fruits
d)  Sandy soil, hot weather and large markets in temperate regions
Answer: A
 Plantation agriculture is confined within tropical areas, i.e., both sides of the equator. Plantations exist on every continent possessing a tropical climate. The plantation system however is considerably older in tropical America than in Asia and Africa.
Plantation agriculture is an export-oriented agriculture.
Plantation agriculture is the product of colonialism. Plantations have been developed in response to a demand in Europe for foods, spices, fibers, and beverages, which because of climatic constraints, could be produced only in the tropics or sub-tropics.

96 Ecotone is a junction between two or more diverse ecosystems. Which of the following is/are the characteristics of Ecotones?
1.  A well developed ecotone may contain organisms that are entirely different from the adjoining communities.
2.  Ecotones may display edge effect where the population density of some species is more in ecotone than adjoining communities.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: Because an ecotone is the zone in which two
User Name :      Kant
communities integrate, many different forms of life have to live together and compete for space. Therefore, an ecotone can create a diverse ecosystem.
So, the ecotone contains not only species common to the communities on both sides; it may also include a number of highly adaptable species that tend to colonize such transitional areas
Statement 2: If different species can survive in both communities of the two biomes, then the ecotone is considered to have species richness that may be greater than adjoining communities.

97 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): There cannot be quorum in Parliament if the Leader of Opposition
(LoP) is absent from House proceedings or is not selected by the opposition.
2.  Reason (R): All censure motions or resolutions against the government on behalf of the house can be raised only by the Leader of Opposition (LoP).
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: D
Quorum in Parliament simply means presence of more than 10% of the actual strength of the House.
It is not related to the absence of presence of any particular member. If LoP or even the Leader of the house (lets say PM) is absent, the house still conducts business.
Censure motions or resolutions against the government on behalf of the house can be raised by any opposition member. So, R is also wrong.

98 The policy of abolition of landlordism and of "land belonging to the tiller" was adopted by the Indian National Congress (INC) since

a)  It was constituted in 1885.
b)  The beginning of Non-cooperation movement
c)  Karachi Session 1931
d)  A 1945 resolution by the Congress Working Committee
Answer: D
 In 1945, the Congress Working Committee adopted a resolution for the abolition of landlordism and the granting of land to the tiller.
This was also the time for the consolidation of the Indian capitalist class within the national movement.
This was not adopted earlier as INC felt it may generate backlash with the landlord community and may not augur well for the Indian national movement.

99 For Gandhiji, non-violence was a matter of principle. But for other leader it was a matter of policy in the independence struggle. It was adopted because
1.  Non-violence would broaden the base of the national movement.
2.  British never followed the rule of law.
3.  Unarmed opposition was never suppressed by the British.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: C
It was essential to achieve these objectives:
To broaden the participation in the movement.
To fight British without arms. They respected rule of law and generally did not crush movements which did not violate the law. It put the rulers in a dilemma. By not acting their position would weaken. By acting their image of a benevolent ruler would be eroded.

100 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): The pyramid of energy in an ecosystem is always upright.
2.  Reason (R): There is loss of energy at each trophic level in being transferred to the higher trophic level.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
  Pyramid of energy is a graphic representation of the amount of energy trapped per unit time and area in different trophic level of a food chain with producers forming the base and the top carnivores at the tip.
Pyramid of energy is always upright. It is so because at each transfer about 80 - 90% of the energy available at lower trophic level is used up to overcome its entropy and to perform metabolic activities. Only about 10% of the energy is available to next trophic level.
