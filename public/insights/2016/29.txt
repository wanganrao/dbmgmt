1.  Gas hydrates are crystalline form of shale gas and petroleum.
2.  They exist in shallow sediments of outer continental margins.
3.  There are no known reserves of Gas Hydrates in India.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  3 only
Answer: C
 Statement 1 and 2: Gas hydrates are crystalline form of methane and water, and exist in shallow sediments of outer continental margins.
Statement 3: Krishna-Godhavari basin has evidence of occurrence of huge thickness of gas hydrates demonstrated by shale fracturing mechanism and world's deep
seated occurrence of gas hydrates have been sampled in Andaman basin.
Delineation of gas-hydrates by geophysical methods is very important for evaluating the resource potential along the Indian continental margin with a view to meet the overwhelming demand of energy for India
The amount of methane potentially trapped in natural methane hydrate deposits may be significant (1015 to 1017 cubic metres), which makes them of major interest as a potential energy resource.
Catastrophic release of methane from the decomposition of such deposits may lead to a global climate change, because CH4 is more of an efficient greenhouse gas than CO2 (see Atmospheric methane).
The fast decomposition of such deposits is considered a geohazard, due to its potential to trigger landslides, earthquakes and tsunamis.
World over gas hydrate is at R&D stage. To meet the challenges of exploring gas hydrate, which is at a research stage the world over, MoPNG / DGH have signed MoU with various agencies for sharing of knowledge and scientific data.

2 If the Parliament introduces a cap of number of pages on newspapers all over-India without the possibility of deriving any clear socio-economic benefits from the same, the legislation will be declared to be
a)  Null and void as it is against Article 19 of the Constitution and reasonable restrictions provided therein.
b)  Valid if it is included in the Ninth Schedule
c)  Valid even if it is not included in the Ninth Schedule
d)  Null and void because the Parliament does not has the jurisdiction to control the publication of newspapers in the country
Answer: A
 The Ninth Schedule protects the legislations from being declared null and void by the court, if they contravene a fundamental right.
But, such caps do not achieve any goals under Part IV of the Constitution. If it did, the legislation might have been valid under Article 31C of the Constitution.
Article 31C in The Constitution Of India 1949 says: Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles:
"Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article 14 or Article 19 and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy?."

News broadcast by All India Radio.
Calendars issued by the Government of India.
Government communications addressed to the members of the public.
Dates of the national calendar have a permanent correspondence with dates of the Gregorian calendar, 1 Chaitra falling on 22 March normally and on 21 March in leap year.

4 Which of the following anciently known as Gharapuri, the island capital of Konkan Mauryas, is celebrated for its colossal image of Mahesamurti with three heads each representing a different form?
a)  Ajanta caves
b)  Ellora caves
c)  Elephanta caves
d)  Barabar caves
Answer: C
The Elephanta caves is a conglomeration of seven caves, out of which the most important is the Mahesa-murti cave.
The main body of the cave, excluding the porticos on the three open sides and the back isle, is 27 metres square and is supported by rows of six columns each. The gigantic figures of 'dvarapalas' or doorkeepers are very impressive. There are sculptured compartments in this cave with remarkable images of Ardhanarisvara, Kalyana-sundara Shiva, Ravana lifting Kailasa, Andhakari- Murti (slaying of Andhaka demon) and Nataraja Shiva.
The cave complex has been given the status of world heritage by UNESCO.

5 Which of the following 
1.  Ocean currents transport heat from the equator to the poles regulating local temperature en route.
2.  Large quantities of methane trapped as hydrates on the ocean floor may be released causing global warming.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: It occurs through a heat- and saline-driven process called thermohaline circulation.
Warm water moves from the equator northward along the ocean surface and eventually cools.
As it cools, it becomes dense and heavy and sinks. This cold water then moves south along the lower part of the ocean and rises near the equator to complete the cycle.
This is a natural process that contributes to a proper temperature balance across the earth.
Statement 2: Methane hydrates are fragile. At the sea floor the ice-like solid fuel composed of water and methane is only stable at high pressure and low temperature. In some areas, for instance in the North Atlantic off the coast of Svalbard, scientists have detected gas flares regularly.
The rise in sea temperature may trigger the release of large quantities of methane, trapped as hydrates on the ocean floor.
Both these phenomena would increase the greenhouse effect, and so further global warming.

6 Consider the following map of India.
The shaded area in the map given above is the major producer of which one of the
following?
a)  Mustard
b)  Cotton
c)  Groundnut
d)  Rice
Answer: C
Major Growing States are Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra ,Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh.
India is the second largest producer of groundnuts in the world.
Groundnut is the major oil seed crop in India and it plays a major role in bridging
the vegetable oil deficit in the country. Groundnuts in India are available throughout the year due to a two-crop cycle harvested in March and October. Ground Nuts are important protein crops in India grown mostly under rain-fed conditions.

7 Which of the following statements is/are correct?
a)  If a country has high fiscal deficit, its GDP must be growing.
b)  If a country is experiencing inflation, its real GDP must be increasing.
c)  Both (a) and (b)
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
High fiscal deficit may or may not translate into higher or positive growth depending on the economic situation. It may result in high growth, low growth, no growth or even negative growth. So, (a) is incorrect.
Inflation inflates the nominal GDP (above the real GDP) by the amount of the inflation. For e.g. if the actual value of production is Rs. 1000, and inflation has been 10% YoY, then even without an increase in actual production the value of nominal GDP can be Rs. 1100. It does not increase the real GDP. So, (b) is wrong.

8 Which of the following have a bearing on the governance of North-Eastern States?
1.  Part IX of the Constitution
2.  Part IXA of the Constitution
3.  Sixth Schedule
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 The Status of North Eastern States with regard to Self-Governing Institution can be seen under Part IX and Part IXA of the Constitution and Special Constitutional Provisions (Article 371 series).
Part IX of the Constitution deals with the Panchayats that can be setup in these areas. Part IXA of the Constitution deals with the Municipalities. Sixth Schedule of the Constitution contains special provisions as to the Administration of Tribal Areas in the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura
and Mizoram.
It also envisages an autonomous District Council for the tribal areas in these states.

9 Which of the following was NOT supported by Bal Gangadhar Tilak?
a)  Age of Consent bill
b)  No-revenue campaign of 1896-97
c)  Theory of the arctic home of the Aryans
d)  All were supported by him.
Answer: A
 We are quoting few useful paragraphs on Tilak from Sumit Sarkar:
"Tilak was a pioneer in many ways-in the use of religious orthodoxy as a method of mass contact (through his alignment against reformers on the Age of Consent issue, followed by the organization of the Ganapati festival from 1894), in the development of a patriotic-cum historical cult as a central symbol of nationalism (the Shivaji festival, which he organized from 1896 onwards), as well as in experimenting with a kind of no-revenue campaign in 1896-97.
The countervailing cotton excise of 1896 produced intense reactions in western India on which Tilak tried to base something like a boycott movement-the first trial use of a method which was to become the central nationalist technique from 1905 onwards."
He also founded the anti-cow-killing society, and set up the home rule league at
Poona.

10 In which of the following states/UTs you are most likely to find tropical forests as well as sub-tropical forests, bamboo forests, pine forests, temperate forests and alpine forests all?

Answer: B
The vegetation of Arunachal Pradesh falls under four broad climatic categories and can be classified in five broad forest types with a sixth type of secondary forests. These are tropical forests, sub-tropical forests, pine forests, temperate forests and alpine forests.
Forest Cover Map of Arunachal Pradesh
Vegetation in Assam: may broadly be divided into (I) Evergreen forests, (II)Mixed
Deciduous forests, (III) Riverain forests and (IV) Savannah.
Alpine forests: The Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows extend along the north and south faces of the Himalaya Range from the Kali Gandaki Gorge in central Nepal eastwards through Tibet and India's Sikkim state, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh state, and northernmost Myanmar.

11 Gamocha and Barpeta's Bhortal Nritya are associated with
a)  Assamese people
b)  Central Indian tribes
c)  Indigenous communities of Nilgiri Hills
d)  Agraria community of Gujarat
Answer: A
It is one of the most easily recognizable cultural symbols of the Assamese people.
The Gamocha, a white rectangular piece of cotton hand woven cloth with primarily a red border on three sides and red woven motifs on the fourth (in addition to red, other colors are also used) is put to many uses.
It is also hung around the neck at the prayer hall and thrown over the shoulder to signify social status or respect.
Gamochas, also known as bihuwaans, are offered during Bihu as a token of love.
Significantly the gamocha is used equally by all, irrespective of religious and
ethnic backgrounds (see image below).
Bhor Tal Nritya
It is an extension of Sankari culture. Six to ten dancers equipped with cyrnbols perform this dance to the first bit of '7hiya Nom" and produces a
good number of attractive formations displaying the cymbols.
The dance can be seen during festive occasions in and around Barpeta and
Guwahati.

a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: C
Concept and information:Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes.
The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. Up to
50% of severely affected persons without treatment will die from yellow fever. The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America.
Vaccines have been developed for Yellow Fever.
The conditions are conducive in India i.e. presence of mosquito vectors in abundance and susceptible population. Government of India has been following a strict yellow fever vaccination programme to prevent the entry of yellow fever in India.
Strategy of Government of India for prevention of entry of yellow fever disease into India has been screening of all international passengers for vaccination against yellow fever disease.

13 Which of the following is the primary objective of India's foreign policy?
a)  Neutrality in all matters of foreign relations and policies to avoid strategic alignment
b)  Promote an external environment conducive to domestic inclusive growth and c)  Increasing its political weight in the World by controlling neighbour republics
d)  Advance territorial rights and claims to continuously increase India's territory
Answer: B
 India's foreign policy seeks to safeguard the country's enlightened self- interest.
The primary objective of India's foreign policy is to promote and maintain a peaceful and stable external environment in which the domestic tasks of inclusive economic development and poverty alleviation can progress rapidly and without obstacles.
Given the high priority attached by the Government of India to socio-economic development, India has a vital stake in a supportive external environment both in our region and globally.
India, therefore, seeks a peaceful periphery and works for good neighbourly relations in its extended neighbourhood.

Vidyanjali will also cover initiatives under the Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) and Public Private Partnership (PPP), with Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) Companies, private corporate and others.
Statement 1: The Centre and States organize the Teacher Eligibility 
While the teachers in schools are responsible for all teaching-learning processes, a Volunteer at a school could enrich the teaching-learning process by conducting co-scholastic activities.
The volunteers will therefore be engaged for co-scholastic activities and not be a replacement for the regular teachers and neither will they be involved in any kind of formal teaching.

19 Faujdar and Amalguzar during the reign of Akbar were
a)  In charge of law and order, and collection of revenue respectively.
b)  Chiefs of local government having different responsibilities in different parts of the empire
c)  Head of Mansab groups
d)  In charge of managing the royal treasury, and administering criminal justice respectively.
Answer: A
At the sarkar level, there were two important functionaries, the faujdar and the amalguiar.
Faujdur was the executive head of the sarkar. But his area of influence seems more complex.
His duty was mainly to take care of rebellious and law and order problems. His jurisdiction was decided according to the needs of the region.
His primary duty was to safeguard the life and property of the residents of the area under his jurisdiction.
As the chief executive of the region, the faujdar was to keep vigil over the recalcitrant zamindars, in special circumstances, he was to help the amalguzar in matters of revenue collection.
Amalguzar: The most important revenue collector was the amil or amalguzar. His
primary duty was to assess and supervise the revenue collection through other subordinate officials.

20 Consider the following statements.
1.  Tsunamis grow in height when they reach shallower water.
2.  Tides are an important driving force behind occurrence of Tsunamis.
3.  Most tsunamis happen within the Pacific Ocean's 'Ring of Fire'.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
 Statement 1: In deep Ocean, tsunami waves may appear only a foot or so high. But as they approach shoreline and enter shallower water they slow down and begin to grow in energy and height. The tops of the waves move faster than their bottoms do, which causes them to rise precipitously.
Statement 2: It is not tides. It can be earthquakes, volcanism, underwater landslides etc.
Statement 3: About 80 percent of Tsunamis happen within the Pacific Ocean's "Ring of Fire," a geologically active area where tectonic shifts make volcanoes and earthquakes common.

21 MSME sector has been playing an important role in socio-economic development of the country. Consider the following about it.
1.  More than half of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from MSMEs.
2.  The primary responsibility of promotion and development of MSME's is of the State
Governments.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Statement 1: MSME sector contributes around 8% of GDP, 40% of the total exports and around 45% of the manufacturing output. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: While the primary responsibility of promotion and development of MSME's is of the State Governments, Government of India, supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various initiatives.
 For e.g. the role of the Ministry of MSME is to assist the States in their efforts to encourage entrepreneurship, employment and livelihood opportunities and enhance the competitiveness of MSME's in the changing economic scenario.
The schemes/ programmes undertaken by the Ministry seek to facilitate/provide; adequate flow of credit from financial institutions/banks; support for technology upgradation and modernization; integrated infrastructural facilities; modern 

22 As opposed to major minerals, which are administered by Central government, the regulatory and administrative jurisdiction of minor minerals falls under the purview of State governments. Which of the following is/are minor minerals?
1.  Shale
2.  Coal
3.  Iron Ore
4.  Gypsum
5.  Mica
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 4 and 5 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1, 2 and 5 only
d)  All are minor minerals.
Answer: A
 If you know coal and iron ore are major minerals (which they logically should be), correct answer can be easily found. So, 2 and 3 won't be in the correct option, and the only answer can be (a).
 Major minerals are those specified in the first schedule appended in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act 1957) and the common major minerals are Lignite, Coal, Uranium, iron ore, gold etc.
It may be noted that there is no official definition for "major minerals" in the MMDR Act. Hence, whatever is not declared as a "minor mineral" may be treated as the major mineral.
The major-minor classification has nothing to do with the quantum
/availability of these minerals, though it is correlated with the relative value of these minerals.
The Central Government has notified 31 minerals as 'minor' minerals in February 2015 to delegate entire regulation for these 31 minerals to States. This increased the number of minerals notified as 'minor' minerals from 24 to
55.
It will empower States to frame their own rules for grant and regulation of these 31 minerals. States are also enabled to prescribe the method for grant of mineral concessions, rates of royalty, contribution to DMF etc. for these minerals.

b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 4 only
d)  3 and 4 only
Answer: C
 Apart from the above, Varanasi is famous for its finest silk sarees and
brocades.
The patola or ikat technique is related to silk production.
The Patolas of Gujarat; The ballet of bandhej; The Tanchois of Gujarat are all related to Silk production. You can read more about them at the Q Source.
Following is the comprehensive list of Silk centres in India.

24 Warsaw outcomes are related to which of the following?
a)  Fighting international terrorism jointly by states party to the United Nations
b)  Pledge of upliftment of the vulnerable and disabled with support from the
United Nations
c)  Leading towards consensus in global climate change related agreements
d)  Providing greater market access to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in developed markets
Answer: C
At the UN Climate Change Conference in Warsaw, governments took further essential decisions to stay on track towards securing a universal climate change agreement in 2015.
The objective of the 2015 agreement is twofold:
First, to bind nations together into an effective global effort to reduce emissions rapidly enough to chart humanity's longer-term path out of the danger zone of climate change, while building adaptation capacity. Second, to stimulate faster and broader action now.
To these ends, governments agreed to communicate their respective contributions towards the universal agreement well in advance of the meeting in Paris in 2015.

25 If news is broadcast from London at noon, at what time it will be heard at Syria?
a)  Same day at midnight.
b)  Same day at 6 AM.
c)  A day before midnight.
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Syrian time zone is +2:00 ahead of the Prime Meridian time. So, the news will be heard at around 2 PM in Syria.
Even if you do not know the exact longitude of Syria, the answer can be easily arrived at by approximation.
Indian time zone is +5:30 of Prime Meridian, and Syria falls in between India and Prime Meridian. So, none of options (a), (b) or (c) can be correct, as the time difference will always be at least less than 5.30 hrs between Syria and London.

26 Seamount ferromanganese crusts are known to enrich several high-value metals such as cobalt, platinum, cerium and tellurium. Many national projects are assessing and exploring this valuable marine resource. Consider the following about it.
1.  They occur in areas of significant volcanic activity.
2.  They float on water by virtue of their structural density.
3.  They are found where ocean currents prevent deposition of unconsolidated sediments.
4.  They are more enriched in Cobalt metal than the abyssal polymetallic nodules.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: D
 Ferromanganese crusts are hydrogenous colloidal precipitates, which are known to record oceanographic conditions contemporaneous to their growth period
Statement 1: Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts occur at shallower depths of <400 to about > 5000 meters in areas of significant volcanic activity.
Statement 2 and 3: The crusts grow on hard-rock substrates of volcanic origin by the precipitation of metals dissolved in seawater in areas of seamounts, ridges, plateaus and where prevailing currents prevent deposition of unconsolidated sediments and occupy large areas on top of these topography highs.
In many cases, the deposits occur within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the countries.
Statement 4: They are 3-6 times more enriched in Cobalt metal than the abyssal polymetallic nodules and deep-water crusts.
 The Ministry of earth Sciences is working on a project to identify areas of occurrence of cobalt-enriched ferromanganese crusts, assessment of resource potential of co-rich deposits on Afanasiy-Nikitin seamount in the Afanasiy-Nikitin Seamount region.
Similar in general composition to the polymetallic nodules, cobalt crusts are attracting investment in exploration for higher cobalt percentage (up to 2%),
platinum (0.0001%) and Rare Earth Elements (REE) besides Nickel and Manganese.
The commercial interest in the cobalt crust is recent.
However, the mining technology for these deposits is likely to be more complex than the polymetallic nodules.

27 Consider the following about United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

2.  It had replaced the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: The Council was created by the United Nations General Assembly in 2006. It is an inter-governmental body responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing
situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them.
It has the ability to discuss all thematic human rights issues and situations that require its attention throughout the year. It meets at the UN Office at Geneva.
Statement 2: The Council is made up of 47 United Nations Member States which are elected by the UN General Assembly. The Human Rights Council replaced the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

28 Which of the following about the National Mineral Exploration Policy (NMEP) is
INCORRCT?
a)  It intends to nationalize the oil and gas exploration sector to cut down monopolies.
b)  It aims at reducing private sector control over other mineral sectors to eliminate misuse of India's mineral resources.
c)  Both (a) and (b)
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
 It primarily aims at accelerating the exploration activity in the country through enhanced participation of the private sector.
There is a need for comprehensive mineral exploration of the country to uncover its full mineral potential (by widening the investment base) so as to put the nation's mineral resources (non-fuel and non-coal) to best use and thereby maximize sectoral contribution to the Indian economy. So, clearly both (a) and (b) are incorrect.
The policy emphasizes on making available baseline geo-scientific data of world standards in the public domain, quality research in a public-private partnership, special initiatives for search of deep-seated and concealed deposits, quick aero-geophysical surveys of the country, and creation of a dedicated geo- science database etc.

29 Which of the following is NOT one of the working areas of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF)?
a)  Foster global monetary cooperation
b)  Facilitate international trade
c)  Reduce poverty around the world
d)  Design national intellectual property agreements
Answer: D
 It is an organization of 189 countries, working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.
The IMF's primary purpose is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system-the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries (and their citizens) to transact with each other.
The Fund's mandate was updated in 2012 to include all macroeconomic and financial sector issues that bear on global stability.
Created in 1945, the IMF is governed by and accountable to the 189 countries that make up its near-global membership.

31 Consider the following statements.Assertion (a): Coriolis Effect is more towards the Poles rather than at Equator. Reason (R): Earth rotates from West to East.In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: B
 The Coriolis Effect is caused by the rotation of the Earth and the inertia of the mass experiencing the effect.
The Coriolis Effect is caused by the rotation of the Earth and the inertia of the mass experiencing the effect.
Because the Earth completes only one rotation per day, the Coriolis force is quite small, and its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the
atmosphere or water in the ocean.
Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important.
This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.
The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles and smallest at the equator, since the rate of change in the diameter of the circles of latitude when travelling north or south, increases the closer the object is to the poles.

32 Which one among the following is NOT a provision under the framework of the World
Trade Organization?
a)  Anti-dumping and export subsides
b)  Reduction of trade barriers within regional groupings
c)  Providing financial support to the countries having deficit balance of payments

34 In the post-Vedic period, the Sanghas or Ganarajyas were institutions of
a)  Self-Governance
b)  Autocracy
c)  Despotic malevolence
d)  Kinship
Answer: A
 The history of democratic traditions in India goes back to the Vedic period.
The Vedas abound with references to popular asscmh lies known as the
Sanghas and the Samitis.
Apart from electing the king, these assemblies used to discuss and decide matters of State.
Discussions in these assemblies were free and a resolution passed by them was binding on all and inviolable.
In the post- Vedic period, the Republics which were known in popular parlance as Ganarajva or Sangha were functioning as self-governing institutions.
In those Sanghas rules of Parliamentary procedure were in existence and many of those rules were akin to the modern day procedures followed in Parliaments.
They had rules regarding seating arrangement in an Assembly, moving of Motions including Censure Motion, Resolutions, determining Quorum and issuance of Whip.

c)  Gulf of Kutch and Gulf of Khambat along with some areas near Gulf of
Mannar
d)  They are found in all of the above locations.
Answer: A
 It is the largest of all living reptiles.
The saltwater crocodile is one of the three crocodilians found in India, the other two being the more regionally widespread, smaller mugger crocodile and the narrow-snouted, fish-eating gharial.
Apart from the eastern coast of India, the saltwater crocodile is extremely rare on the Indian subcontinent.
A large population is present within the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary of Odisha and they are known to be present in smaller numbers throughout the Indian and Bangladeshi portions of the Sundarbans. The saltwater crocodile also persists in bordering Bangladesh as does the mugger and gharial. Populations are also present within the mangrove forests and other coastal areas of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India.
A project for breeding crocodiles, started in 1974, has been instrumental in saving the crocodile from extinction.

37 Consider the following about causes of tribal movements in British India.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
 Statement 1: For e.g. outsiders from the plains started entering tribal areas like -moneylenders, traders, land-grabbers an contractors. Called the dikus,
they were hated by the Santhals of Jharkhand.
Statement 3: For e.g. khuntkatti tenure in Chota Nagpur was a system of joint ownership which was destroyed by the British inciting severe discontentment.
 A new but increasingly important factor from the 1870s and '80s was the tightening of control by the colonial state over forest zones for revenue purposes.
Shifting cultivation- which required no plough animals and therefore was often essential for the survival of the poorest in rural society-was banned or restricted in the 'reserved' forests from 1867 onwards, and attempts were made to monopolize forest wealth through curbs on use of timber and grazing facilities.

38 Which of the following is/are some special provisions for North-eastern states of India?

b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
NER States have a weak financial base and limited scope to raise additional resources due to their small size, remoteness, terrain and internal fund raising constraints.
Statement 1: They are, therefore, are unable to contribute the states' share as per the norms of the Centrally Sponsored Plan Schemes of the Ministries / Departments of the Union Government.
Hence, funding norms of Centrally Sponsored Schemes have been progressively liberalised by the Ministries and Departments for the North Eastern States.
The States' contribution to Centrally Sponsored Schemes now range generally between 10% to 20% whereas for other states it is between 20% to 50%.
These states are also allowed to divert 20 per cent of the Normal Central
Assistance (NCa) under the plan to meet non-plan expenditure.
Statement 2: Greater tax holidays, lower taxation on industrial entities, also for e.g. under section 10 (26) of IT Act, an eligible employee residing in the specified region is exempt from Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on any income earned while employed in that region.

42 Consider the following statements.Assertion (a): India's oldest mountain range is Aravali.Reason (R): Aravalis are Fold Mountains.In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: B
 Many other mountains like Himalayas are also fold mountains, but the fact that they are fold mountains doesn't make them old. So, answer is (b).
The Aravalli Range is the eroded stub of a range of ancient folded mountains.
Old fold mountains are characterized by having stopped growing higher due to the cessation of upward thrust caused by the stopping of movement of the tectonic plates in the Earth's crust below them.
In ancient times they were extremely high but since have worn down almost completely by millions of years of weathering. In contrast, the Himalayas are continuously rising young fold mountains of today.

India.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Statement 1: Insurance has a deep-rooted history in India. It finds mention in the writings of Manu ( Manusmrithi ), Yagnavalkya (Dharmasastra ) and Kautilya ( Arthasastra ).
The writings talk in terms of pooling of resources that could be re-distributed in times of calamities such as fire, floods, epidemics and famine. This was probably a pre-cursor to modern day insurance.
Ancient Indian history has preserved the earliest traces of insurance in the form of marine trade loans and carriers' contracts.
Statement 2: Insurance in India has evolved over time heavily drawing from other countries, England in particular.

1818 saw the advent of life insurance business in India with the establishment of the Oriental Life Insurance Company in Calcutta. This Company however failed in 1834.
In 1829, the Madras Equitable had begun transacting life insurance business
in the Madras Presidency.

1870 saw the enactment of the British Insurance Act and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century many were started in the Bombay Residency. This era, however, was dominated by foreign insurance offices.

47 In Theravada Buddhism, the Patimokkha is/are
a)  Buddha's relics
b)  Monastic code of Discipline
c)  Way of Meditation
d)  Another name for Bodhisattvas
Answer: B
It was the basic code of monastic discipline, consisting of many rules for
fully ordained monks and nuns.
It is contained in the Suttavibhanga, a division of the Vinaya Pitaka.
The four parajikas (defeats) are rules entailing expulsion from the sangha for life.
If a monk breaks any one of the rules he is automatically "defeated" in the holy life and falls from monkhood immediately.
He is not allowed to become a monk again in his lifetime. Intention is necessary in all these four cases to constitute an offence e.g. stealing, celibacy, killing, falsehood etc.

48 Consider the following statements.Assertion (a): The Velocity of a raindrop falling in air first increases continuously and then becomes constant.Reason (R): The atmosphere creates a drag on raindrops that increases with its velocity.In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.
Answer: A
 It is explained by the concept of terminal velocity, which is the steady speed achieved by an object freely falling through a gas or liquid.
Terminal velocity is achieved, therefore, when the speed of a moving object is no longer increasing or decreasing; the object's acceleration (or deceleration) is zero.
The force of air resistance is approximately proportional to the speed of the falling object, so that air resistance increases for an object that is accelerating, having been dropped from rest until terminal velocity is reached.
At terminal velocity, air resistance equals in magnitude the weight of the falling object.
Because the two are oppositely directed forces, the total force on the object is zero,
and the speed of the object has become constant.

61 The immediate cause of Swadeshi movement was
a)  Partition of Bengal
b)  Widespread famine in Bengal
c)  Peasant discontentment with British Rule
d)  Zamindar revolts and rising unemployment
Answer: A
 During 1901, Bengal had become the nerve centre for Indian nationalism. At that time it was the biggest province of British India and included parts of Bihar and Orissa.
To weaken it, Lord Curzon (1899-1905) the Viceroy of India, proposed partition of
Bengal.
The official reason was stated as administrative inconvenience due to the size of Bengal. But partition itself was based on a religious and political agenda. Bengal was to be divided into two regions i.e. East Bengal and Assam out of the rest of
Bengal. Thus to reduce the nationalist movement in Bengal and thereby in the entire country.
But the Indian nationalists saw the design behind partition and condemned it
unanimously, starting the anti-partition and the Swadeshi movements. The Swadeshi movement was also known as Vandemataram movement in deltaic Andhra Pradesh.

The Central Government has established a National Human Organs and Tissues Removal & Storage Network named NOTTO, which stands for National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation.
NOTTO will have five Regional Networks ROTTO (Regional Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization) and each Region of the country will develop SOTTO (State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation) in every State/ UT. Each hospital of the country related to transplant activity, whether as retrieval or transplant, has to link with NOTTO, through ROTTO/SOTTO as a part of National Networking.

63 Which one of the following cities will never get the vertical rays of the Sun?
a)  Srinagar
b)  Pune
c)  Patna
d)  Vishakhapatnam
Answer: A
 The Sun is exactly vertically overhead at least one point lying between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn during an entire year.
During the summer, in the Northern hemisphere, places near Tropic of Cancer are more likely to receive vertical rays.
It applies similarly to places near Tropic of Capricorn in winter in the Southern
Hemisphere.
So, any places outside the tropical zone will not see the vertical rays of the Sun, so
Srinagar is a correct option.

 It marked the end of three decades of technology denial in the nuclear field.
Under it, India agreed to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities and to place all its civil nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEa) safeguards and, in exchange, the United States agreed to work toward full civil nuclear cooperation with India.
The deal is seen as a watershed in U.S.-India relations and introduces a new aspect to international non-proliferation efforts.
In 2008, the IAEA approved the safeguards agreement with India, after which the United States approached the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to grant a waiver to India to commence civilian nuclear trade.
NSG granted the waiver to India to access, civilian nuclear technology and fuel from other countries.
The implementation of this waiver made India the only known country with nuclear weapons which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but is still allowed to carry out nuclear commerce with the rest of the world Following the signing of this bilateral agreement, agreements for civil nuclear cooperation have been signed with France, Russia and Kazakhstan.

Answer: A
 The hill tracts of Vizagapatam were inhabited by hill tribes who led a more or less independent way of life for centuries
These tribes paid a regular tribute to a zamindar or mansabdar who was a subject of British India
The then zamindar of the region was an oppressive tyrant. There had been smaller riots and uprisings before, but to make matters worse, the Madras government introduced a law making toddy tapping illegal and introducing a toddy tax. But toddy tapping was a part of their culture.
This led to a full-scale rebellion in early 1879.
In the aftermath of the rebellion, various concilliatory measures were adopted by the British government.
They tried to improve the condition of the tribals of East Godavari agency and the hill tracts in the norther part of Madras Presidency.

region
By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley Civilization are the invasion by the Aryans, the recurrent floods and other natural causes like earthquake, etc.

76 Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) is related to
a)  Provision of telecom services in rural and remote areas
b)  Revival of Public Sector Units (PSUs) across all categories
c)  Serving Foreign Dignitaries on a state visit to India
d)  Pension funds of retired Civil Servants
Answer: A
 Apart from the higher capital cost of providing telecom services in rural and remote areas, these areas also generate lower revenue due to lower population density, low income and lack of commercial activity.
Thus normal market forces alone would not direct the telecom sector to adequately serve backward and rural areas.
Keeping in mind the inadequacy of the market mechanism to serve rural and inaccessible areas on one hand and the importance of providing vital telecom connectivity on the other, most countries of the world have put in place policies to provide Universal Access and Universal Service to ICT.
Thus, the Fund aims to:
Provide widespread and non-discriminatory access to quality ICT services at affordable prices to people in rural and remote areas.
Provide an effective and powerful linkage to the hinterland thereby mainstreaming the population of rural and remote parts of the country. Ensure that universal services are provided in an economically efficient manner.

Answer: A
  Option (b) and (c): Both are related to Medieval India battles, so can't be the answer
Option (d): Battle of Ferozeshah was the First Anglo-Sikh War fought in 1845. So, clearly (d) can't be the answer, as the company had gained political power in India much before that.
Option (a): The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies in 1757. The battle consolidated the Company's presence in Bengal, which later expanded to cover much of India over the next hundred years.

deities, but depict social life. Images of human beings and animals, along with scenes from daily life are created in a loose rhythmic pattern.
Statement 2: Women are mainly engaged in the creation of these paintings. These tribal paintings of Maharashtra are traditionally done in the homes of the
Warlis. Painted white on mud walls, they are pretty close to pre-historic cave
paintings in execution and usually depict scenes of human figures engaged in
activities like hunting, dancing, sowing and harvesting.

80 Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has been pursuing the following 3-stage Nuclear
Power Programme. Consider the following about it.

a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 The first stage comprises setting up of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and associated fuel cycle facilities. PHWRs use natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as moderator and coolant.
The second stage envisages setting up of Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) backed by reprocessing plants and plutonium-based fuel fabrication plants. Plutonium is produced by irradiation of uranium-238.
The third stage is based on the thorium-uranium-233 cycle. Uranium-233 is obtained by irradiation of thorium.
Statement 1: The first stage of Nuclear Power Programme is already in commercial domain. The Fast Breeder Programme is in the technology demonstration stage.
The third stage of the Nuclear Power Programme is in technology development stage.
Statement 2: There is no fourth stage. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. (NPCIL), a public sector undertaking of DAE, is responsible for the design, construction and operation of nuclear power reactors.
The ongoing development of 300 MWe Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR)
at BARC aims at developing expertise for thorium utilization and demonstrating
advanced safety concepts.

Or they may simply be unwilling to work because existing wage levels are too low.
So while jobs are available, there is a serious mismatch between what companies need and what workers can offer.
Structural unemployment is exacerbated by extraneous factors such as technology, competition and government policy.

b)  A stream of fluid flowing past an obstacles break ups into eddies and vortices
c)  The sound produced by whistling and by wind instruments
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Turbulent flow is a type of fluid (gas or liquid) flow in which the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations, or mixing, in contrast to laminar flow, in which the fluid moves in smooth paths or layers. In turbulent flow the speed of the fluid at a point is continuously undergoing changes in both magnitude and direction. The flow of wind and rivers is generally turbulent in this sense, even if the currents are gentle. The air or water swirls and eddies while its overall bulk moves along a specific direction.

86 Consider the following statements about Ayurveda system of Medicine.

Statement 2: All objects in the universe including human body are composed of five basic elements (Panchamahabhutas).
There is a balanced condensation of these elements in different proportions to suit the needs and requirements of different structures and functions of the body matrix and its parts.
The growth and development of the body matrix depends on its nutrition, i.e. on food.
The food, in turn, is composed of the above five elements, which replenish or nourish the like elements of the body after the action of bio-fire (Agni).

87 Whenever any private person wrongfully usurps an office, he is prevented by the writ of quo warranto from continuing in that office. Which among the following is/are the basic conditions necessary for the issue of writ of quo warranto?
1.  The office must be public and must be created by a statute or by the constitution itself.
2.  The office must be a substantive one and not merely the function or employment of a servant at will by a government employee.
3.  There must have been a contravention of prevailing conventions or meritocracy in appointing such persons to the office.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: B
 The term quo warranto means "by what authority
The basic conditions for the issue of the writ are that the office must be public, it must have been created by statute or Constitution itself, it must be of a substantive character and the holder of the office must not be legally qualified to hold the office or to remain in the office or he has been appointed in accordance with law.
Also, there must be a contravention of statues or constitutional provisions in appointing such persons to the office. So, 3 is wrong.
A writ of quo warranto is never issued as a matter of course and it is always within the discretion of the Court to decide.
The Court may refuse to grant a writ of quo warranto if it is vexatious or where the petitioner is guilty of larches, or where he has acquiesced or concurred in the very act against which he complains or where the motive of the relater is suspicious.
As to the question that can apply for writ to quo warranto, it can be stated that any private person can file a petition for this writ, although he is not personally aggrieved in or interested in the matter.
Ordinarily, delay and lashes would be no ground for a writ of quo warranto unless the delay in question is inordinate.

89 How is a democracy helpful in ensuring equal rights for women?
a)  Women are by-default given equal degree of political representation in legislatures in democracies.
b)  Women in democracies cannot be subjected to sex discrimination in any aspect of social life by the very design of democratic institutions.
c)  The principle of Rule of Law in most democracies reduces discrimination against women.
d)  Women are given reservations in political institutions by the design of any
democracy.
Answer: C
 Rule of Law is Critical to Women's Empowerment and Sustainable
There is nothing in the default design of a democratic institution that can prevent discrimination against women. For e.g. many women were denied the right to vote in many democracies in the 1950s.
But, rule of law ensures that what applies to men also applies to women. It depends on the progressive ideals of a state to enact progressive programs for women, and help them with positive discrimination.

97 Gangetic River Dolphins are locally known as 'Susu' because of
a)  Their solitary nature.
b)  The noise they make while breathing
c)  The nature of their sharp fins and nose.
d)  Their ability to jump high in the air.
Answer: B
 River Dolphin is said to represent the purity of the holy Ganga as it can only survive in pure and fresh water.
It has a long pointed snout. Their eyes lack a lens and therefore function solely as a means of detecting the direction of light.
Dolphins tend to swim with one fin trailing along the substrate while rooting around with their beak to catch shrimp and fish.
River Dolphins are solitary creatures and females tend to be larger than males.
They are locally known as susu, because of the noise it makes while breathing.
This species inhabits parts of the Ganges, Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and the Karnaphuli River in Bangladesh.

99 Ever since India commenced her scientific activities in the Arctic region, one of the major locales of study has been the Kongsfjorden system. Why is the site of special interest?
1.  It is an untouched pristine area with no human activities other than scientific research.
2.  It is here that warmer waters of the Atlantic meet the colder waters of the Arctic.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Kongsfjorden is a large icy archipelago (around 40 km length and width of 5 to 10 km), located in the Arctic (Svalbard).
Statement 1: The coal-mining town of Ny-Alesund is located on its southern shore and is one of only 4 permanent settlements on Spitsbergen.
It is also a popular shore break for cruises although it is worried that tourism may cause interference with the sensitive scientific devices in the settlement.
So, clearly 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: The point of interest is its climatic importance.
It lies in the northwest coast of Spitsbergen, the main island of Svalbard, and is a site where warmer waters of the Atlantic meet the colder waters of the Arctic. s
Being an open fjord without sill it is largely influenced by the processes on the adjacent shelf.
There is also a large variation in the seasonality of the phytoplankton biomass and primary production here.
Considering the scope of scientific research the locale afforded and the fact that an integrated study of the fjord has been has been identified as a flagship program of the Svalbard Research Program (SSF), NCAOR (India) in consultation with the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) began exploring the feasibility of initiating a major long-term program on the fjord during 2009-10.

100 Consider the following about the rock systems of India.
1.  The Archean rocks are found in Deccan Peninsular and parts of North-east.
2.  The Dharwar rocks are rich in iron ore.
3.  Cudappah System rocks can be found only in Himalayas.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: A
 Statement 1: Archean rocks, also known as Pre-Cambrian rocks are the oldest rocks of the earth's crust.
The Archean period covers 86.7% of Total geological history time of earth
and therefore is very significant. This period marks the development of first photosynthesis, the life support atmosphere.
The Archean rocks in India are called Purana Rocks means the oldest rocks.
Statement 2: Dharwar system is later than the Archean system but older than the other systems.
The Dharwar period of rock formation has been largely fixed from 2500 million years ago to 1800 million years ago.
Dharwar Rock System is special because it is the first metamorphic sedimentary rocks in India.
They are named Dharwar system because they were first studied in Dharwar region of Karnataka.
But they are also found in Aravallis, Tamil Nadu, Chotanagpur plateau, Meghalaya, Delhi, and the Himalayas region. The Dharwar rocks are rich in iron ore, manganese, lead, zinc, gold, silver etc.
The Champions series containing gold mines lie within this system.
Statement 3: Cudappah System rocks are rich in metamorphic rocks such as sandstone, shale, limestone, quartzite, and slate.
They contain iron and other inferior quality of ores and minerals.
They are mainly found in Cudappah district of Andhra Pradesh along with other places such as Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Delhi, and the lesser Himalayas. One of the important series of Cudappah System is Papaghani series, named after the river of same name in Andhra Pradesh.
