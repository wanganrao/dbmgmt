Option (b): Once the house is dissolved, the very idea of accountability to the legislature dissolves for the time being. Only the President then issues orders.
User Name :      Kant
Option (c): Once the house is dissolved, the CoM cannot prove their majority again. So, it is wrong.

a)  The banks and financial institutions purchase Government securities from the
RBI
b)  Banks and the financial institutions borrow money from the RBI for the short-term
c)  RBI buys commercial papers from the public
d)  None of the above

a)  The zero hour is not mentioned in the Rules of Procedure of the house.
b)  Matters can be raised by members without prior notice.
c)  The zero hour starts before the question hour after which the agenda for the day is taken up.
d)  It is an Indian innovation in the field of parliamentary procedures and has
User Name :      Kant
been in existence since 1962. 
Answer: C
 Unlike the question hour, the zero hour is not mentioned in the Rules of Procedure. Thus it is an informal device available to the members of the Parliament to raise matters without any prior notice.
The zero hour starts immediately after the question hour and lasts until the agenda for the day (ie, regular business of the House) is taken up.
In other words, the time gap between the question hour and the agenda is known as zero hour.

38 Which of the following correctly point out the difference(s) between Censure Motion and No Confidence Motion?
1.  No-confidence motion should state the reasons for its adoption in the Lok Sabha, Censure motion need not.

3.  General discussion.
4.  Passing of finance bill
5.  Passing of appropriation bill.
6.  Voting on demands for grants.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  132564
b)  312654

d)  132654
Answer: D
 Correct order is:
Presentation of budget. General discussion.
Scrutiny by departmental committees Voting on demands for grants. Passing of appropriation bill.
Passing of finance bill.
The general discussion on budget begins a few days after its presentation. It takes place in both the Houses of Parliament and lasts usually for three to four days.
After the general discussion on the budget is over, the Houses are adjourned for about three to four weeks and 24 departmental standing committees examine the budget.
After voting demand for grants, an appropriation bill is introduced to provide for the appropriation, out of the Consolidated Fund of India, all money required to meet:

The grants voted by the Lok Sabha.
The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.

46 'Vote on account' provision is related to
a)  Any grant made in advance by the Lok Sabha to the executive before the passing of appropriation bill
b)  Excess grant awarded by the Parliament to the executive that had been appropriated in the annual budget
c)  Grant made before the 'March Rush' by the Lok Sabha to the executive
d)  Grant sanctioned by Parliament to executive for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of India
Answer: A
 The Appropriation Bill becomes the Appropriation Act after it is assented to by the President.
This act authorises (or legalises) the payments from the Consolidated Fund of India. This means that the government cannot withdraw money from the Consolidated
Fund of India till the enactment of the appropriation bill. This takes time and usually goes on till the end of April.
But the government needs money to carry on its normal activities after 31
March (the end of the financial year).
To overcome this functional difficulty, the Constitution has authorised the Lok Sabha to make any grant in advance in respect to the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial year, pending the completion of the voting of the demands for grants and the enactment of the appropriation bill. This provision is known as the 'vote on account'. It is passed (or granted) after the general discussion on budget is over.
It is generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to one-sixth of the total estimation

A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members and he is invariably from the ruling party.
The function of the committee is to examine the estimates included in
the budget and suggest 'economies' in public expenditure. Hence, it has

d)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
Answer: A
 The Federal Court of India was a judicial body, established in India in 1937 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1935, with original, appellate and advisory jurisdiction.
It functioned until 1950, when the Supreme Court of India was established. The Federal Court had exclusive original jurisdiction in any dispute between
the Central Government and the Provinces.
Initially, it was empowered to hear appeals from the High Courts of the provinces in the cases which involved the interpretation of any Section of the Government of India Act, 1935.

The Centre and one or more states; or
The Centre and any state or states on one side and one or more states on the other; or
Between two or more states.
In the above federal disputes, the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction.
Exclusive means, no other court can decide such disputes and original means, the power to hear such disputes in the first instance, not by way of appeal.

 Judicial review is the power of the Supreme Court to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and state governments.
On examination, if they are found to be violative of the Constitution or fundamental rights (ultra-vires), they can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional and invalid (null and void) by the Supreme Court. Consequently, they cannot be enforced by the Government.
Judicial review is needed for the following reasons:
To uphold the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution.
To maintain federal equilibrium (balance between Centre and states). To protect the fundamental rights of the citizens

55 How is the Governor of a state appointed?
a)  Indirectly elected by the State Legislative Assembly
b)  Nominated by the President
c)  Elected by a collegium consisting of the heads of all local bodies of the concerned State
d)  Nominated by the State Government subject to the approval of the
Union Government
Answer: B
  The governor is neither directly elected by the people nor indirectly elected by a specially constituted electoral college as is the case with the president.
He is appointed by the president by warrant under his hand and seal. In a
way, he is a nominee of the Central government. But, as held by the Supreme Court in 1979, the office of governor of a state is not an employment under the Central government.
It is an independent constitutional office and is not under the control of or subordinate to the Central government.

 One other constitutional discretion is determining the amount payable by the Government of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram to an autonomous Tribal District Council as royalty accruing from licenses for mineral exploration.
In addition to the above constitutional discretion (i.e., the express discretion mentioned in the Constitution), the governor, like the president, also has situational discretion (i.e., the hidden discretion derived from the exigencies of a prevailing political situation) in the following cases:
Appointment of chief minister when no party has a clear-cut majority in the state legislative assembly or when the chief minister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor
Dismissal of the council of ministers when it cannot prove the confidence of the state legislative assembly.
Dissolution of the state legislative assembly if the council of ministers has lost its majority

 The simple majority system of representation does not represent the whole electorate. On the other hand, even the smallest section of the population gets its due share of representation in the legislature in the PR system.
There are two kinds of proportional representation, namely, single transferable vote system and list system.
In India, the first kind is adopted for the election of members to the Rajya Sabha and state legislative council and for electing the President and the Vice-President.
Though some members of the Constituent Assembly had advocated the system of proportional representation for the election of members to the Lok Sabha, the Constitution has not adopted the system due to two reasons.
Difficulty for the voters to understand the system (which is complicated) due to low literacy scale in the country. Unsuitability to the parliamentary government due to the tendency of the system to multiply political parties leading to instability in government.
