1 Why tank irrigation is more practiced in South India as compared to other forms of irrigation like canal and wells?
1.  It is difficult to dig canals and wells due to undulating relief and hard rock structure.
2.  Low percolation of rain water due to hard rock structure
3.  Many rivers of South India are seasonal in nature.
4.  Population and agricultural fields are scattered which makes canal irrigation economically unviable.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2 and 3 only
b)  1 and 4 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
Tank is an artificial reservoir. Tank use is critical in parts of South India without perennial rainfall where water supply replenishment is dependent on monsoon seasons.
Most of the rivers of this region are seasonal and dry up in summer season. Therefore, they cannot supply water to canals throughout the year.
There are several streams which become torrential during rainy season. The only way to make best use of this water is to impound it by constructing bunds and building tanks. Otherwise this water would go waste to the sea. Most of the tanks are natural and do not involve heavy cost for their construction. Even an individual farmer can have his own tank.
Tanks are generally constructed on rocky bed and have longer life span. In many tanks, fishing is also carried on. This supplements both the food resources and income of the farmer.

2 The system of price controls was an important component of Alauddin Khalji's market reforms. Why were price controls placed?
a)  It was the duty of a welfare state.
b)  To reduce the remuneration paid to the large army
c)  Gain more competitiveness in grain trade with neighbouring states
d)  Stabilizing markets from unnecessary price inflation by producers
User Name :      Kant
Answer: B
 Khilji's military ambitions required a standing and strong army, especially after the Mongol siege of Delhi.
Maintaining a large army at regular salaries, however, would be severe drain on the treasury. A system of price controls reduced the salary amount that needed to be paid.
He placed markets under the control of a high officer called 'Shahna' for strictly controlling the shopkeepers and prices.
Land revenue was fixed and the grain was stored in government granaries.

3 The Mahar movement and Shri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) Movement were two important backward class movements in India. What was the ideological difference between these two movements?
a)  Former relied on total rejection of Hinduism, but the latter relied at a new interpretation of Hinduism for reform.
b)  Former followed non-violence as a core ideology, whereas the latter believed in violent dismantling of the government apparatus.
c)  Former believed in ground work for caste reforms, whereas the latter believed in joining Central and Provincial legislatures to achieve caste reforms by political means
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 When Ambedkar lead the Mahar movement, he rejected the Gandhian approach relying on change of the heart of caste Hindu and of incorporating the Harijan in the Sudra Varna; he decided to abandon Hinduism altogether and along with five lakhs Mahars embraced Buddhism.
SNDP had a different approach.
Narayana Guru (founder of SNDP) built a number of temples, which were declared open to all castes.
User Name :      Kant
He also simplified rituals regarding marriage, religious worship, and funerals. Narayana Guru achieved a notable success in transforming the untouchable groups into a backward class.
He criticized Gandhi for his faith in Chaturvarna, which he considered the parent of the caste system and untouchability. He gave a new slogan "one religion, one caste and one God for mankind".

4 Consider the following statements.Assertion (a): Highest concentration of plankton is found at tropics and subtropics.Reason (R): Sunlight can be found abundantly at tropics
and sub-tropics that is vital for the growth of plankton.In the context of the above, which of
these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
Answer: D
Highest concentration of plankton is found at higher latitudes, tropics and subtropics have lower concentrations.
It is due to nutrient limitation brought about by strong, year-round thermocline
(temperature gradients) and pycnocline (salinity gradients).
Pycnocline refers to the rapid change in density with depth, and thermocline, a rapid change in temperature with depth. Both of these limit circulation of nutrients to the surface where planktons grow.
However, in areas where ocean upwelling occurs, nutrients are cycled to the surface and rich plankton grounds can be found.

5 Areas near the equator receive more direct solar radiation than areas near the poles. However, these areas do not constantly get warmer and warmer. Why?
1.  Regions near equator reflect all the heat received back to space.
User Name :      Kant
2.  Ocean waves and winds transport the heat from the lower latitudes to higher latitudes.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: The earth as a whole reflects all the heat, but the same cannot be said of a particular place or region, for e.g. equator. So, 1 is incorrect.
Statement 2: It is not waves that transport heat, it is Ocean currents. Waves do not move water but only the energy. It is the fundamentals of physics.
Large quantities of heat can be absorbed and stored in the surface layers of the ocean. This heat is transported by ocean currents. In this way, the ocean currents help regulate Earth's climate by facilitating the transfer of heat from warm tropical areas to colder areas near the poles.

Answer: D
Odisha coast has the world's largest known rookery of Olive Ridley sea turtle.
Apart from Gahirmatha rookery, two other mass nesting beaches have been located which are on the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi.
The spectacular site of mass congregation of Olive Ridley sea turtles for mating and nesting enthralls both the scientists and the nature lovers throughout the world.
This unique phenomenon is hardly seen anywhere in India. That rarity of mass congregation and the cruelty meted out to these innocent marine creatures, paved the way for declaration of the stretch of water body from old light house near Batighar to Maipura river mouth as Gahirmatha (Marine) Wildlife Sanctuary.
Gahirmatha is the only marine wildlife sanctuary of Odisha.

13 India has many endemic plant and vertebrate species and endemism rich areas. Which one among the following regions comes last in the richness of endemic population?
a)  Eastern Himalayas
b)  Andaman and Nicobar Islands

17 Winters are very cold in the continental steppes of Eurasia when compared to the steppe type climate in Southern hemisphere due to
a)  The large geographical extent of steppes in Eurasia
b)  Blowing of Chinook winds in Southern hemisphere
c)  Presence of warm Humboldt Current in the Southern hemisphere
d)  Large distance from sea in Eurasia
Answer: D
 We can take Pretoria in South Africa as an example, which is located near Velds grasslands.
It has a subtropical climate, which accounts for its short winters, which are relatively dry, and its long but wet summers.
But, since it is located near the sea, temperature is moderate heavily.
However, in Eurasia, due to enormous distance from sea, the moderating effects of the sea do not affect the climate at all, and the winters become very cold.
Chinook blows in the Northern hemisphere. So, (b) is incorrect.

18 The focus of National Urban Transport Policy 2014 formulated by the Central
Government is
a)  "Move People Not Vehicles"
b)  "One city One transport"
c)  "Cut Emissions Not number of vehicles"
d)  "One city One transport Tariff"
Answer: A
The vision statement of the National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) acknowledges that people occupy centre-stage, and that cities must evolve in a manner that supports the main social and economic activities taking place there.
The NUTP aims to bring about equitable use of road space with people and not vehicles as the focus.
The NUTP is more of a policy framework containing general guidelines rather than rules that are implemented. Further, transport is a state subject, thus making the issue of access to the Central government a tricky issue.
Considering this, the Centre had to tie include some components of NUTP in JNNURM, and make the funding dependent on the implementation. This is how many cities have introduced BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System). This has also led states to explore setting up of metros.

19 Consider the following statements about money bills with regard to State legislature.

20 There has been a lot of focus in India on developing Cryogenic Engines indigenously. What advantage does cryogenic engine has over conventionally used rocket engines?
a)  It does not require fuel and can operate by burning atmospheric gases as fuel.
b)  It is more efficient than provides greater thrust for the same amount of
propellant burnt.
c)  The engine does not have any emissions when compared to a conventional engine.
d)  Only cryogenic engines can take us to the geostationary orbits, conventional
engines have not been able to.
Answer: B
 A Cryogenic rocket stage is more efficient and provides more thrust for every kilogram of propellant it burns compared to solid and earth-storable liquid propellant rocket stages. Specific impulse (a measure of the efficiency) achievable with cryogenic propellants (liquid Hydrogen and liquid Oxygen) is much higher compared to earth storable liquid and solid propellants, giving it a substantial payload advantage.
However, cryogenic stage is technically a very complex system compared to solid or earth-storable liquid propellant stages due to its use of propellants at extremely low temperatures and the associated thermal and structural problems.

23 Which of the following can be the longest lasting greenhouse gas in the atmosphere?
a)  Fluorinated gases
b)  Methane
c)  Nitrous oxide
d)  Argon
Answer: A
 Methane, by contrast, is mostly removed from the atmosphere by chemical reaction, persisting for about 12 years. Thus although methane is a potent greenhouse gas, its effect is relatively short-lived.
Nitrous oxide is destroyed in the stratosphere and removed from the atmosphere more slowly than methane, persisting for around 114 years.
Fluorinated gases are removed from the atmosphere only when they are destroyed by sunlight in the far upper atmosphere. In general, fluorinated gases are the most potent and longest lasting type of greenhouse gases emitted by human activities.
The lifetime in the air of CO2, the most significant man-made greenhouse gas, is probably the most difficult to determine, because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

24 A steady increase in the concentration of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in Earth's atmosphere can affect India in which of the following ways?

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
  Statement 1: It is projected that by the end of the 21st century, rainfall will increase by 15 - 31% and high concentration of GHGs will increase the mean annual temperature by about 3 degree Celsius. This may lead to melting of glacier and the increased rainfall to floods in the catchment areas.
Statement 2: Water expands on heating and contribution of melting of glaciers will cause sea level rise. It can have the following effects:
Deltas will be threatened by flooding, erosion and salt intrusion; Loss of coastal mangroves will have impact on fisheries
Effect on livelihoods and local communities
Statement 3: Plants grow in a narrow range of temperature. Increase in average temperature also results in more pests and insects attack, and an overall decline in agricultural productivity and production.

27 How is the Chairman of Legislative Council selected?
a)  Nominated by the Governor from amongst the members of the Council
b)  Selected by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly
c)  Elected by the council itself from amongst its members.
d)  The Senior-most member of the Council automatically becomes its
Chairman.
User Name :      Kant
Answer: C
 As a presiding officer, the powers and functions of the Chairman in the council are similar to those of the Speaker in the assembly.
However, the Speaker has one special power which is not enjoyed by the Chairman. The Speaker decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not and his decision on this question is final.
As in the case of the Speaker, the salaries and allowances of the Chairman are also fixed by the state legislature. They are charged on the Consolidated Fund of the State and thus are not subject to the annual vote of the state legislature.
He resigns by writing to the Deputy Chairman. He can be removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then members of the council.

34 The basic cause of Monsoon climate is the
a)  Difference in the rate of heating and cooling of land and sea
b)  Upper air circulation along with jet streams
c)  Alternation of warm and cold currents
d)  Presence of obstructing mountains in the path of planetary winds
Answer: A
 The monsoon is essentially the seasonal reversal in wind direction.
The apparent position of the Sun with reference to the Earth oscillates from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. Thus, the low pressure regions created by solar heating also changes latitude.
The northeast and southeast trade winds converge in this low pressure zone, which is also known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ.
This low pressure regions sees continuous rise of moist wind from the sea
User Name :      Kant
surface to the upper layers of the atmosphere, where the cooling means the air can no longer hold so much moisture resulting in precipitation.
The rainy seasons of East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and the southern parts of North America coincide with the shift of ITCZ towards these regions.

35 The eastern coasts of continents within the tropics have much heavier rainfall than the interiors or the west coasts. This is because
1.  All western coasts fall in the rain shadow zone.
2.  Trade winds cause precipitation blowing to the eastern side.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Islands and coastal areas 10° to 20° north or south of the equator usually have a tropical marine climate. The ocean is the main influence in creating the tropical marine climate. The temperature ranges from 25°C to 35°C. The trade winds blow all year round. The trade winds are moist, as they have passed over warm seas. Since they are easterlies, they cause greater precipitation on the eastern coasts and run dry on the western coasts and interiors.

36 Consider the following about the use of language(s) in Parliament.
1.  Assertion (a): A member of the house cannot address the House in his mother tongue.
2.  Reason (R): The Constitution has declared Hindi and English to be the languages for transacting business in the Parliament.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A
User Name :      Kant
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect
d)  A is incorrect, but R is correct
Answer: D
 Hindi and English are to be the languages for transacting business in the
Parliament as per the constitution.
However, the presiding officer can permit a member to address the House in his mother tongue. In both the Houses, arrangements are made for simultaneous translation.
 Though English was to be discontinued as a floor language after the expiration of fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution (that is, in
1965), the Official Languages Act (1963) allowed English to be continued along with Hindi.

37 Atacama Desert is the driest non-polar desert in the world where the mean annual rainfall is not even an inch. This is due to
1.  Presence of Cold Peruvian current on the Chilean coast
2.  It being situated in the interior of South America
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Statement 1: The cold Peruvian current creates a region of high pressure along the coasts. So, moisture laden winds from the Sea do not cross the coasts and don't come to Atacama deserts.
Statement 2: The Atacama Desert is a plateau in South America, covering a 1,000- kilometre strip of land on the Pacific coast, west of the Andes mountains. So, 2 is clearly wrong.
User Name :      Kant
Other reasons:
The Andes Range runs along the Atacama Desert, acting as a formidable natural barrier from the moisture of the Amazon; the rain shadow effect. The Atacama Desert is also located over high altitudes, above 2,500 metres above sea level. This contributes to low drying temperatures and very low humidity in the air.

2.  Burning large amounts of fossil fuels
3.  Reducing the capacity of oceans to absorb carbon dioxide
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Climate change is caused on earth by:
Variations in the sun's energy reaching Earth
Changes in the reflectivity of Earth's atmosphere and surface
Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earth's atmosphere
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels.
Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.
Oceans and forests absorb CO2. If their capacity to absorb carbon is reduced, climate change will accelerate.

b)  3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Kautilya, who played a significant role in the design of Mauryan administrative apparatus, knows that men are fickle, corruptible and unpredictable. Therefore, he suggests preventive measures to keep employees on the path of honesty and loyalty to the king.
To ensure the loyalty of government servants, he assigns a significant role to the bureau of espionage, for the bureau can instil in them the fear of detection and consequent punishment
Different registers were kept to facilitate checking and strict instructions laid down for the detection of embezzlement. Frequent transfer of officials was recommended as a means of checking corruption.
Kautilya prescribes techniques to ensure the integrity and loyalty of administrative services.
The king is advised to be extremely generous to those officials who prove to be above temptation and ruthlessly severe to those who misuse powers, misappropriate funds or betray responsibilities.

 The Japan Current begins off the east coast of Taiwan and flows north-eastward past Japan, where it merges with the easterly drift of the North Pacific Current.
It is analogous to the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, transporting warm, tropical water northward towards the polar region.
The warm waters of the Kuroshio Current sustain the coral reefs of Japan, the northernmost coral reefs in the world, and they are also responsible for the higher temperatures recorded near British Columbia.

58 Which of the following is a lethal heat resistant spoilage organism in the canning industry?
a)  E.coli
b)  Prokaryota. C
c)  Bacillus subtilis
d)  Clostridium botulinum
Answer: D
 All of the sterilization treatments tend to affect adversely the material to be preserved, and often only partial sterilization is used in order to minimize dam- age to the product
For e.g. pasteurization of milk and other products, such as beer, is aimed at the destruction of heat-sensitive human pathogens and an overall reduction in microbial numbers; the complete sterilization of milk and beer by heat would render them unpalatable.
In the canning industry, the most dangerous and highly heat-resistant spoilage organism is Clostridium botulinum.
Minute amounts of the bowfin neurotoxin produced by this spore-forming anaerobe can cause rapid fatality by respiratory paralysis.
Canned food products that may serve as substrates for Clostridium and other endospore-forming bacteria need extensive heat processing to eliminate all
viable endospores.

The CPEC is part of China's regional transnational 'One Belt One Road' (OBOR) initiative that connects large patch of Asia and Eastern Europe. Gwadar Port is strategically located and lies close to the Strait of Hormuz (near Iran), a key international oil shipping lane.
It could open up an energy and trade corridor from the Gulf region across Pakistan to western China and also could be used by the Chinese Navy for military purpose
The CPEC will give China land access to the Indian Ocean, cutting the nearly
13,000 km sea voyage through the Strait of Malacca (major chokepoint) and around India to 2,000 km road journey from Gwadar to Kashgar.
The development of Kashgar as a trade terminus will reduce isolation of the underdeveloped Xinjiang province and deepen its engagement with the rest of China

60 Consider the following statements
User Name :      Kant
1.  It is produced from molasses, one of the by-products of Sugar industry.
2.  The Government had decided its mandatory blending with petrol should be implemented across the country
The above refers to?
a)  Butanol
b) Bio-diesel
c) Bio-starch
d)  Ethanol
Answer: D
 Ethanol is an agro-based product, basically produced from the by- product of the sugar industry, viz. molasses. In the years of surplus production of sugarcane, when the sugar prices are depressed, the sugar industry is unable to pay cane price to the farmers
This is mainly due to surplus production of sugar. The ethanol blended petrol programme, besides lowering pollution levels, is expected to provide another outlet for ethanol use, thus insuring utilization of molasses produced as a by-product during manufacture of sugar.
It was decided by the Government that 5 per cent mandatory ethanol blending with petrol should be implemented across the country and procurement price of ethanol will be decided between Oil Marketing Companies and suppliers of ethanol.
This is expected to generate revenue for sugar mills enabling them to avoid building up of cane price arrears.

1.  Importers
2.  Exporters
3.  Corporate external borrowers
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  1 only
c)  3 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: B
 Statement 1: Importers benefit as foreign goods become cheaper to buy.
Statement 2: Exporters suffer as now domestic export become costlier in international markets and they lose their competitiveness. We have covered this concept earlier too
Statement 3: When the local currency is appreciating the debt service liability is falling in domestic currency terms for the corporate borrower
A sharp depreciation in local currency would mean corresponding increase in debt service liability, as more domestic currency would be required to buy the same amount of foreign exchange for debt.

64 Base Rate is the interest rate below which
a)  Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) would not lend to consumers
b)  SCBs would not borrow from RBI
c)  RBI would not lend to SCBs
d)  SCBs cannot give interest for the public bank deposits
Answer: A
 It is like the Prime Lending Rate (PLR) and the Benchmark Prime lending Rate (BPLR) of the past and is basically a floor rate of interest.
User Name :      Kant
It replaced BPLR in 2010.
Base Rate system is aimed at enhancing transparency in lending rates of banks and enabling better assessment of transmission of monetary policy.
This was because in the earlier system banks could lend below BPLR
This allowed bargaining by the borrower with bank. So, ultimately one borrower was getting cheaper loan than the other, and blurred the attempts of bringing in transparency in the lending business.
For the same reason, it was also difficult to assess the transmission of policy rates (i.e. repo rate, reverse repo rate, bank rate) of the Reserve Bank to lending rates of banks.

68 The institution of high court originated in India when
a)  Supreme Court took charge in Independent India and established High courts in many states
b)  The Morley-Minto Act provided for the establishment of High courts
c)  During the British rule when the high courts were set up at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
d)  The 1773 Regulating Act created the Supreme Court as well as the High
Courts
Answer: C
The institution of high court originated in India in 1862 when the high courts were set up at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras.
In 1866, a fourth high court was established at Allahabad. In the course of time, each province in British India came to have its own high court.
After 1950, a high court existing in a province became the high court for the corresponding state.
The Constitution of India provides for a high court for each state, but the Seventh Amendment Act of 1956 authorised the Parliament to establish a common high court for two or more states or for two or more states and a union territory.

80 Lichens are generally the first community to colonize a bare rock. This is because
a)  They can withstand dry conditions.
b)  They do not require nutrients for growth.
c)  Lichens consume on Mosses.
d)  Lichens survive on pollen grains blown by the Wind.
Answer: A
 Succession takes place in a series of stages, each called a sere.
At each stage, certain species can be identified which change the environment so that it becomes more suitable for other species.
Imagine an area of bare rock. One of the few kinds of organism capable of surviving on such an inhospitable area is lichen.
Lichen is therefore a pioneer species. As a symbiotic relationship between an alga and a fungus, a lichen can survive considerable drying out.
In time, weathering of this base rock produces sand or soil, although in itself this cannot support other plants.
However, as the lichens die and decompose they release sufficient nutrients to support a community of small plants.
Mosses are typically the next stage in succession, followed by ferns. With the continuing erosion of the rock and the increasing amount of organic matter available from these plants, a thicker layer of soil is built up.
This then supports small flowering plants such as grasses and, by turn, shrubs and trees.

 Conservation reserves and community reserves in India are terms denoting protected areas of India which typically act as buffer zones to or connectors and migration corridors between established national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserved and protected forests of India.
Such areas are designated as conservation areas if they are uninhabited and completely owned by the Government of India but used for subsistence by communities, and community areas if part of the lands are privately owned.
Administration of such reserves would be through local people and local agencies like the gram panchayat. But, they are declared by the State government.

85 Wetlands are said to be one of the largest sources of the Greenhouse gas, Methane. What in the wetlands releases methane?
a)  Bacteria that decompose organic material in the absence of oxygen
b)  Roots of the plants that take up methane from the soil.
c)  Nutrient imbalance releases methane.
d)  Both (a) and (b)
Answer: D
Wetlands are characterized by water-logged soils and distinctive communities of plant and animal species that have evolved and adapted to the constant presence of water. Due to this high level of water saturation as well as warm weather, wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of atmospheric methane.
Most methanogenesis, or methane production, occurs in oxygen poor environments. Because the microbes that live in warm, moist environments consume oxygen more rapidly than it can diffuse in from the atmosphere, wetlands are the ideal anaerobic, or oxygen poor, environments for fermentation.
Plant aerenchyma refers to the vessel-like transport tubes within the tissues of certain kinds of plants. Plants with arenchyma possess porous tissue that allows for

95 Why 'Sacred Groves' hold an important place in the design of environmental conservation policy in India?
a)  It shows the importance of community-led conservation.
b)  It shows how remote forests are better preserved than open forests.
c)  It shows how legally protected forests do better than non-protected forests.
d)  It shows how grant of land rights to tribals can result in better conservation.
Answer: A
 Sacred Groves are relic forest patches traditionally protected by communities in reverence of a deity.
n absence of statutory protected areas and in the wake of mass deforestation in some parts of India, Sacred Groves form important repositories of forest biodiversity and provide refuge to many plant and animal species of conservation significance. India has well over 13,000 documented Sacred Groves.
Almost every village in the Sahaydri-Konkan region (north Western Ghats) has at least one Sacred Grove ranging from just a few acres to hundreds of acres.
Sacred Groves are not only important sites for regional biodiversity but also provide vital ecosystem services to local people.
Often streams and rivers originate from Sacred Groves or wells and tanks are seen within or near the groves which form important water source for the rural population.
These community forests harbor valuable biodiversity and are under tremendous pressure and threats such as encroachments for agriculture, grazing, developmental activities like roads, dams, canals, urbanization and
industrialization.

c)  British withdrawal of only British citizens from the ongoing war in South-
User Name :      Kant
east Asia angered the Indians.
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
The Quit India movement was not a meticulously planned movement as the previous mass movements.
The masses were already frustrated with the British not giving them the right to self-govern. This became clear with the failure of the Cripps Mission which only offered a dominion status for India.
The incoming famine made people even more impatient that raised food prices and caused food shortage.
Further, the news came in that the British have left Indian subjects to die in the war at Burma. But, they had evacuated British citizens.
This infuriated the leaders and the masses. In their opinion, if there was invasion from the side of Burma, this would be the fate of Indians too. The British would simply flee.
All these led to the Quit India movement.

d)  None
Answer: C
 Black carbon, commonly known as soot, is a form of particulate air pollution, produced from incomplete combustion from biomass
burning, cooking with solid fuels, and diesel exhaust.
User Name :      Kant
It consists of pure carbon in several linked forms.
Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing albedo, the ability to reflect sunlight, when deposited on snow and ice.
BC is the strongest absorber of sunlight and heats the air directly. In addition, it darkens snow packs and glaciers through deposition and leads to melting of ice and snow.
Regionally, BC disrupts cloudiness and monsoon rainfall and accelerates melting of mountain glaciers such as the Hindu Kush-Himalayan glaciers.

99 What is the major theme running common between the Central Indian and Rajasthani schools of painting?
a)  They are deeply rooted in the Indian traditions.
b)  They are highly secular in nature.
c)  They are unaffected by historical developments and carry a unique style.
d)  They use light colours to portray extra-terrestrial themes.
Answer: A
Unlike Mughal painting which is primarily secular, the art of painting in Central India, Rajasthani and the Pahari region etc. is deeply rooted in the Indian traditions, taking inspiration from Indian epics, religious texts like the Puranas, love poems in Sanskrit and other Indian languages, Indian folk-lore and works on
musical themes.
The cults of Vaishnavism, Saivism and Sakti exercised tremendous influence on the pictorial art of these places.
Among these the cult of Krishna was the most popular one which inspired the patrons and artists.
The Rajasthani style of painting including that of Malwa, is marked by bold drawing, strong and contrasting colours. The treatment of figures is flat without any attempt to show perspective in a naturalistic manner.
