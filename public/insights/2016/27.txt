1 The Sur Empire may be considered in many ways as a continuation and culmination of the Delhi Sultanate. Which of the following were some of the reforms introduced by Sher Shah?
1.  He repealed the land revenue system to promote a welfare state.
2.  He restored the old imperial Grand Trunk Road from the river Indus in the west to
Sonargaon in Bengal.
3.  Customs duties were abolished on goods to promote trade and commerce.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: B
Statement 1: He re-established law and order and dealt sternly with robbers and with zamindars who refused to pay land revenue or disobeyed the orders of the government. So, 1 is incorrect.
Statement 2: Sher Shah paid great attention to the fostering of trade and commerce and the improvement of communications in his kingdom. Sher Shah restored the old imperial road called the Grand Trunk Road, from the river Indus in the west to Sonargaon in Bengal.
Statement 3: Sher Shah also introduced other reforms to promote the growth of trade and commerce. He fixed standards for weights and measures, which helped trade
and commerce.
In his entire empire, goods paid customs duty only at two places: goods produced in Bengal or imported from outside paid customs duty at the border of Bengal and Bihar, and goods coming from West and Central Asia paid customs duty at the Indus.
No one was allowed to levy customs at roads, ferries or towns; anywhere else.
 Sher Shah did not make many changes in the administrative divisions prevailing since the Sultanat period. A number of villages comprised a pargana. The pargana was under the charge of the shiqdar, who looked after law and order and general administration, and the ,nunsif or amil who looked after the collection of
land revenue. Accounts were maintained both in the Persian and the local
languages(Hindavi).

2 Consider the following statements.
1.  The North-West Indian Region mineral belt is associated with Dharwar system of rocks.
2.  Manganese deposits cannot be found in Dharwar system of rocks.
3.  Uranium deposits occur in the Dharwar rocks.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: C
Statement 1: This belt extends along Aravali in Rajasthan and part of Gujarat and minerals are associated with Dharwar system of rocks. Copper, zinc have been major minerals.
Statement 2: Manganese deposits are found in almost all geological formations, however, it is mainly associated with the Dharwar system.
Statement 3: Important minerals used for the generation of nuclear energy are uranium and thorium.
Uranium deposits occur in the Dharwar rocks. Geographically, uranium ores are known to occur in several locations along the Singbhum Copper belt.
It is also found in Udaipur, Alwar and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan, Durg district of Chhattisgarh, Bhandara district of Maharashtra and Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh.
Thorium is mainly obtained from monazite and ilmenite in the beach sands along the coast of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

3 Which of the following threatens the population of Sea turtles in India?
1.  Accidental capture in fishing gear
2.  Genetic engineering projects on sea turtles
3.  Poaching and trade of parts of sea turtle
4.  Loss of coral reefs and sea grass beds
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  1, 2 and 3 only
c)  1, 3 and 4 only
d)  2 and 4 only
Answer: C
 Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over- exploitation. Other major reasons are:
They face habitat destruction and accidental capture in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. It alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings.
Some also kill turtles for medicine and religious ceremonies.
Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on beaches and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around the world. Turtle feeding grounds such as coral reefs and sea grass beds are damaged
and destroyed by activities onshore, including sedimentation from clearing of land and nutrient run-off from agriculture.
Warmer sea surface temperatures can also lead to the loss of important foraging grounds for sea turtles, while increasingly severe storms and sea level rise can destroy critical nesting beaches and damage nests.

4 Why ozone hole is predominant at Antarctic (South Pole) as compared to Arctic (North
Pole)?
a)  Southern polar region is colder and more isolated than the north.
b)  Stratospheric clouds are not formed over the Arctic region.
c)  Permafrost of Antarctic region has been leaching ozone-depleting substances slowly in the atmosphere for a long time.
d)  Presence of Boreal forests subdues ozone hole formation in Arctic, unlike
Antarctica which is largely barren.
Answer: A
About Colder temperatures: Air temperatures in both polar regions reach minimum values in the lower stratosphere in the winter season. Average daily minimum values over Antarctica are at least 10 degrees lower than the Arctic.
Lower temperatures favor the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)
which serve as platforms for catalytic ozone breakdown.
Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are formed in the polar ozone layer when winter minimum temperatures fall below the formation temperature of about
-78Â°C.
This occurs on average for 1 to 2 months over the Arctic and 5 to 6 months over Antarctica.
Therefore, since the Southern region is colder and colder for a longer time, it helps ozone depletion.
About isolation of Antarctica: Unlike the Arctic, the circulation over the Antarctic is more persistent and vortex-like as a consequence of having less land. Air inside the vortex is prevented from mixing with warmer, ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. This vortex is not a feature of the Arctic. The chemistry of ozone loss works in both poles, but their meteorological conditions are different, and more supportive in Antarctica.

5 Consider the following about developments in Ancient India.
1.  The earliest epigraphic evidence for the 'use of the decimal system is in the beginning of the fifth century AD.
2.  Zero was discovered by the Indians around the second century B.C.
3.  Aryabhatta formulated the rule for finding the area of a triangle.
4.  In the second century B.C. Apastamba produced a practical geometry for the construction of altars at which the kings could offer sacrifices.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: D
All statements are correct. The information given below is important and you should be thoroughly acquainted with it, as ancient Indian discoveries has been quite often in news.
By the third century, mathematics, astronomy and medicine began to develop separately.
In the field of mathematics the ancient Indians made three distinct contributions the notation system, the decimal system and the use of zero. The earliest epigraphic evidence fot the 'use of the decimal system is in the beginning of the fifth century AD.
The Indian notational system was adopted by the Arabs who spread it In the
Western world.
The Indian numerals are called Arabic in English, but the Arabs themselves llcd their numerals hindsa.
Before these numerals appeared in the West they had been used in India for centuries. They are found in the inscriptions of Asoka, which were written in the third century B.C.
The Indians were the first to use the decimal system. The famous mathematician Aryabbata (AID. 476-500) was acquainted with it. The Chinese learnt this system from the Buddhist missionaries, and the Western world borrowed it from the Arabs when they came in contact with India. Zero was discovered by the Indians in about the second century B.C.
In the second century B.C. Apastamba produced a practical geometry for the construction of altars at which the kings could offer sacrifices. It describes acute angle, obtuse angle, right angle.
Aryabhata formulated the rule for finding the area of a triangle, which led to the origin of trigonometry. The most famous work of this time is the Suryasiddhanta, the like of which is not found in contemporary ancient East.

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 Statement 1: They were disposed by the Governor-General-in council.
The Council functioned as a joint consultative board. But, as the amount and complexity of business of the Government increased, the work of the various departments was distributed amongst the members of the Council only the more important cases being dealt with by the Governor-General or the Council collectively.
Statement 2: This procedure was legalised by the Councils Act of 1861 during the time of Lord Canning, leading to the introduction of the portfolio system and the inception of the Executive Council of the Governor-General.
The Secretariat of the Executive Council was headed by the Private Secretary to the Viceroy, but he did not attend the Council meetings.
Lord Willingdon first started the practice of having his Private Secretary by his side at these meetings. Later, this practice continued and in November,
1935, the Viceroy's Private Secretary was given the additional designation of
Secretary to the Executive Council.
The constitution of the Interim Government in September 1946 brought a change in the name, though little in functions, of this Office.
The Executive Council's Secretariat was then designated as Cabinet
Secretariat.

12 Consider the following statements about India's external debt.
1.  India's external debt statistics are released by Department of Commerce.
2.  A rise in outstanding NRI deposits tends to increase India's external debt.
3.  Commercial borrowings do not form part of India's external debt.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
 Statement 1: As per the standard practice, India's external debt statistics for the quarters ending March and June are released by the Reserve Bank of India with a lag of one quarter and those for the quarters ending September and December by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. So, 1 is wrong.
Statement 2: India's external debt at end-March 2016 witnessed an increase of 2.2 per cent over its level at end-March 2015, primarily on account of a rise in outstanding NRI deposits. So, clearly statement 2 is correct.
However, the increase in the magnitude of external debt was partly offset by valuation gain resulting from the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Indian rupee and other major currencies.
The external debt to GDP ratio stood at 23.7 per cent at end-March 2016. Statement 3: Commercial borrowings continued to be the largest component of
external debt with a share of 37.3 per cent, followed by NRI deposits (26.1 per cent)
and short-term trade credit (16.5 per cent).

13 Which one of the following is NOT related to the formation or modification of the present atmosphere?
a)  Solar winds
b)  Degassing
c)  Differentiation
d)  Photosynthesis
Answer: C
Option (a): The early atmosphere, with hydrogen and helium, is supposed to have been stripped off as a result of the solar winds.
Option (b): The early atmosphere largely contained water vapour, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and very little of free oxygen. The process through
which the gases were outpoured from the interior is called degassing.
Option (d): Finally, the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis.
Option (c): It is through the process of differentiation that the earth forming material got separated into different layers. Starting from the surface to the central parts, we have layers like the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core.

2.  They are amongst those few tribal groups that have institutionalised the caste system.
3.  The Mishings have their own language, but no script of their own.
4.  The 'Amrok' is their harvest festival.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  3 and 4 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: C
 Statement 1: The Miris, also known as Mishings, are the second largest schedule tribe of Assam. Mostly they are based on riverine areas like
Lakhimpur, Dibrugarh, Sibsagar, Jorhat and Sonitpur.
Statement 2 and 3: Social structure: The Mishing family is generally a joint family. The eldest member of the family is highly respected.
Inheritance in the family is a patrilineal one, and the social structure - patriarchal.
Daughters have no right over the property. There is no caste system or ideas of slavery in the Mishing society.
The Mishings have their own language, but no script: hence they use the Assamese language when the written form is required.
Statement 4: 'Porag' is the social festival observed by the villagers after harvesting the 'Ahu' rice. Neighboring villagers are invited for celebrations that go on through the night, with a lot of singing and dancing. A great feast is arranged on the event. The 'Amrok' is the festival observed when food from the harvested crop is offered.

17 Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) can be used for
a)  Underwater communications
b)  Determining the depth of water beneath ships and boats
c)  Finding aircraft location in the event of a crash in the sea
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 It is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate,
 It is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.
Dedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication.
Sonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea.
Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish's air-
filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater.
This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air.

18 Consider the following statements.
1.  Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain, and are different from biomes.
2.  Palearctic, Australasia, Oceania, Antarctic as categorized by the World Wildlife
Federation (WWF) as Ecozones. Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: An ecozone is the broadest biogeographic division of the
Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms.
Ecozones delineate large areas of the Earth's surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated from one another by geographic features, such as oceans, broad deserts, or high mountain ranges, that constitute barriers to migration.
They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes.
Statement 2: The patterns of distribution of living organisms in the world's ecozones were shaped by the process of plate tectonics, which has redistributed the world's land masses over geological history.
For e.g. the Australasia ecozone includes Australia, Tasmania, the islands of
Wallacea, New Guinea, the East Melanesian islands, New Caledonia, and New
Zealand.

19 Which of the following statements about G-20 is INCORRECT?

b)  It was disbanded recently in 2015 due to lack of consensus between members
on major global economic issues.
c)  The Prime Minister represents India in the G20 Leaders' Summit.
d)  All of the above are correct.
Answer: B
 G20 is a forum of the Heads of Governments of the 19 major economies and the EU for global cooperation on international economic and financial issues.
The European Union is represented in G20 by the President of the European
Council.
The forum has come into existence with the first summit of the Leaders of G20 held in Washington D.C. in November 2008 in the wake of global financial crisis.
Subsequently, the forum met biannually in 2009 and 2010 and annually since
2011. Frequently organised Leaders' summits of G20 in 2008, 2009 and 2010 resulted in a momentum of its influence because of significant decisions that were taken to avert the impact of Global financial crisis of 2008.
The Prime Minister represents India in the G20 Leaders' Summit.
The Finance Minister of India and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India represent in the Finance Ministers and the Central Bank Governors meetings. Mr. Arvind Panagariya represents as India's Sherpa in G20.
Ministerial Meetings are represented by the Cabinet Ministers of the respective Ministries.

20 Which of the following is NOT one of the objectives of Disinvestment in India?
a)  Promoting people's ownership in Public Sector Entreprises (PSEs)
b)  Unlock true value of PSEs for investors and government
c)  Ensure better corporate governance of the PSEs
d)  Increase the foreign presence of PSEs
Answer: D
The policy on disinvestment has evolved considerably through President's address to Joint Sessions of Parliament and statement of the Finance Minister's in their Budget Speeches.
The salient features of the Policy are:
(i) Public Sector Undertakings are the wealth of the Nation and to ensure this wealth rests in the hands of the people, promote public ownership of CPSEs;
(ii) While pursuing disinvestment through minority stake sale in listed CPSEs, the Government will retain majority shareholding, i.e. at least 51 per cent of the shareholding and management control of the Public Sector Undertakings;
(iii) Strategic disinvestment by way of sale of substantial portion of Government shareholding in identified CPSEs upto 50 per cent or more, alongwith transfer of management control.
Option (d): PSEs like ONGC (Videsh) have been able to enhance their foreign presence even without much disinvestment. Moreover, it is not a listed objective of the Disinvestment policy, nor is it considered as an aim to be achieved as a consequence of disinvestment.

23 DOTS treatment is related to which disease?
a)  Tuberculosis
b)  Polio
c)  Measles
d)  Cholera
Answer: A
Modern anti-TB treatment can cure virtually all patients. It is, however, very important that treatment be taken for the prescribed duration, which in every case is a minimum of 6 months.
Because treatment is of such a long duration and patients feel better after just 1-2 months, and because many TB patients face other problems such as poverty and unemployment, treatment is often interrupted.
Therefore, just providing anti-TB medication is not sufficient to ensure that patients are cured.
The DOTS strategy ensures that infectious TB patients are diagnosed and treated effectively till cure, by ensuring availability of the full course of drugs and a system for monitoring patient compliance to the treatment.

24 Consider the following about earth's biodiversity based on the presently available species inventories.
1.  Majority of all the recorded species are plants.
2.  Number of fungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.
3.  Among animals, insects are the most species-rich taxonomic group.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3

Statement 2: Below is image taken from NCERT that summarizes the species diversity
Statement 3: Among animals, insects make up more than 70 per cent of the total. That means, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects.

25 Tejas recently in news is a/an
a)  Indigenously developed Lightweight multi-role fighter jet
b)  Reported old indigenous species of Western Ghats
c)  Underwater observatory in Bay of Bengal to study Seagrass
d)  Indigenously developed micro-nuclear reactor
Answer: A
Tejas is a single-engine lightweight multi-role fighter jet. It has been pegged as world's smallest and ligh
It is outcome of India's LCA programme, which began in the 1983 to replace
country's aging MiG-21 fighters.
It is a tailless and having compound delta wing design. It is powered by a single engine.
It is mounted with inbuilt MultiMode Radar (MMR), Radar Warning
Receiver (RWR) systems.
LCA Tejas has a limited reach of a little over 400-km. It will be mainly used for close air-to-ground operations.
LCA Tejas is not the first indigenous fighter to be inducted into the IAF. In April 1967, IAF had formed the first operational squadron with the indigenous HF-24 Marut fighter.

26 Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. But, the impact of acid rain on soil is less in India because
a)  Acid rains do not occur in India.
b)  Acid rains are restricted to mountainous regions.
c)  Indian soils are mostly alkaline with good buffering ability.
d)  India's forests are not infested with fungal diseases.
Answer: C
Many alluviam soils in India (e.g. Northern plains, Brahmaputra alluvium) are neutral to alkaline in pH.
Black soils are alkaline in nature due to high amount of salts.
Alkaline soils also develop in arid areas having low rainfall, poor drainage, high temperature and high evaporation.
These soils are do not become highly acidic post-acid rain spells, and have good buffering ability, which is why the impact is observed less in Indian soils.
About impact of acid rain on soil: Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.
The optimum pH of most bacteria and protozoa is near neutrality; most fungi prefer an acidic environment, most blue-green bacteria prefer an alkaline environment.
So after a long run of acid rain, microbial species in the soil and water shift from
bacteria-bound to fungi-bound and cause an imbalance in the micro flora.
This causes a delay in the decomposition of soil organic material, and an increase in fungal disease in aquatic life and forests.

28 The Zabti and Dahsala system of Mughal period are related to
a)  Revenue settlement
b)  Military organization
c)  Criminal Justice
d)  Education of Women
Answer: A
The Dahasala or Zabati system of land revenue collection was introduced by Akbar in 1580s to alleviate the problems arising due to fixing prices every year and doing settlements of revenues of previous years.
This system prevailed from Lahore to Allahabad and in the provinces of Malwa and Gujarat. This remained a standard system of revenue assessment during the greater part of the Mughal empire.
In this system, average produce of ten years was derived. One third of this average produce was fixed in Rupees per Bigha and fixed as share of the state (Mal). Rest two third share was left to the cultivators (Kharaj).

29 Consider the following about the role of International Court of Justice (ICJ).
1.  Only States are eligible to appear before the Court, no private entity can move the
ICJ.
2.  It provides individuals and groups with legal counselling and helps them deal with the authorities of any State in major human rights violation situations.
3.  It is the final appellate court for decisions passed by major international tribunals.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  3 only
Answer: A
Statement 1 and 2: The Court has no jurisdiction to deal with applications from individuals, non-governmental organizations, corporations or any other private entity. It cannot provide them with legal counselling or help them in their dealings with the authorities of any State whatever.
Only States are eligible to appear before the Court in contentious cases. At present, this basically means the 192 United Nations Member States.
Statement 3: The Court is not a supreme court to which national courts can turn; it does not act as a court of last resort for individuals. Nor is it an appeal court for any
international tribunal. It can, however, rule on the validity of arbitral awards.
 However, a State may take up the case of one of its nationals and invoke against another State the wrongs which its national claims to have suffered at the hands of the latter; the dispute then becomes one between States.
The Court can only hear a dispute when requested to do so by one or more States. It cannot deal with a dispute of its own motion. It is not permitted, under its Statute, to investigate and rule on acts of sovereign States as it chooses.
The States concerned must also have access to the Court and have accepted its jurisdiction, in other words they must consent to the Court's considering the dispute in question.
This is a fundamental principle governing the settlement of international disputes, States being sovereign and free to choose the methods of resolving their disputes.
Judgments delivered by the Court (or by one of its Chambers) in disputes between States are binding upon the parties concerned.
Judgments are final and without appeal. If either of the parties challenges their scope or meaning, it has the option to request an interpretation.

The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 and entered into force in
2005.
The detailed rules for the implementation of the Protocol were adopted at COP 7 in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2001, and are referred to as the "Marrakesh Accords." Its first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012.

49 The rural co-operative credit system in India is primarily mandated to ensure flow of credit to the agriculture sector. Consider the following about regulation of cooperative banks in India.
1.  Banking related functions of these banks are regulated by the RBI.
2.  Management related functions of these banks are regulated by respective State
Governments/Central Government. Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Though the Banking Regulation Act came in to force in 1949, the banking laws were made applicable to cooperative societies only in 1966 through an amendment to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Since then there is duality of control over these banks with banking related functions being regulated by the Reserve Bank and management related functions regulated by respective State Governments/Central Government.
The short-term co-operative credit structure operates with a three-tier system - Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) at the village level, Central Cooperative Banks (CCBs) at the district level and State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) at the State level.
PACS are outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and hence not regulated by the Reserve Bank of India.
StCBs/DCCBs are registered under the provisions of State Cooperative
Societies Act of the State concerned and are regulated by the Reserve Bank.

52 Forests are an integral part of major ecosystems on earth and are important because they
1.  Control extremes of heat and cold, rendering the climate more equable.
2.  Tend to reduce the relative humidity of the air by capturing it and increaseevaporation
3.  Tend to increase local precipitation
4.  Help to prevent soil erosion, silting up and consequent overflowing of rivers
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1, 3 and 4 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
 Statement 1: Forests are a major factor of environmental conservation and control extremes of heat and cold, rendering the climate more equable. This effect is particularly marked on the main continental land masses within the tropics as in the north Indian plains where during the long dry seasons the hot dry surface transfers heat energy to the wind.
Statement 2: Forests also tend to increase the relative humidity of the air and retard evaporation. In this way forests afford protection to animals and crops against strong, cold or hot and dry winds, and rays of the sun and prevent desiccation and vegetative retrogression.
Statement 3: Forests tend to increase local precipitation, atleast to the extent of increasing the number of rainy days. Forests enrich the soil with fallen leaves and debris and increase its depth, porosity and water storage capacity
Statement 4: In hilly terrains, forests regulate the water supply, feeding springs in dry weather, promoting a perennial instead of a seasonal stream flow and tending to prevent sudden and violent rises of water during rains and floods. Forests help to prevent soil erosion, landslips, shifting sands and silting up and consequent overflowing of rivers, thus reducing the dangers of floods
On level ground, forests have a draining action; the clearing of forests on wet land increases its swampiness, which in arid regions it may increase the salinity of streams

53 International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is a/an
a)  Specialized agency of the United Nations (UN)
b)  Fund established by the World Bank for developing countries

56 Stem cell has emerged as a new field of life science in view of its potential clinical applications. A stem cell possesses which of the following properties?
1.  The ability to go through numerous cycles of cell division while maintaining the undifferentiated state
2.  The capacity to differentiate into specialised cell types
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possess two properties:
Self-renewal: the ability to go through numerous cycles of cell division while maintaining the undifferentiated state
Potency: the capacity to differentiate into specialised cell types.
The ability of stem cells to self-renew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities, offers significant potential for generation of tissues that can potentially replace diseased and damaged areas in the body, with minimal risk of rejection and side effects.

From the time that the oldest preserved monument on the site (Asoka's column with its projecting capital of lions inspired by Achaemenid art) was erected, Sanchi's role as intermediary for the spread of cultures and their peripheral arts throughout the Maurya Empire, and later in India of the Sunga, Shatavahana, Kushan and Gupta dynasties, was confirmed.
Option (c): The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is intimately linked with the development of Darjeeling as the queen of hill stations and one of the main tea- growing areas in India, in the early 19th century.
It was adopted by the British East India Company as a rest and recovery station for its soldiers in 1835, when the area was leased from Sikkim and building of the hill station began, linked to the plains by road.
Option (d): It contains monuments of two distinct religions, Brahminism and
Jainism. The most important group of monuments is massed in the western zone, not far from the archaeological museum, including the temples of Varaha, Lakshmana, Matangeshwara, Kandariya, Mahadeva Chitragupta, Chopra Tank, Parvati, Vishwanatha and Nandi

2.  As per the system, God is matter, and matter is God.
3.  The system denies the existence of soul and instead focuses on various way of self- mortification of the body to attain salvation
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  3 only
Answer: B
 Statement 1 and 3: The term is loosely used to imply all the religious exercises and acts of self-mortification of Indian religion, the earnest follower of such practices being a yogi. But, the school does not deny that there is a soul (see description for Statement 2).
In this broad sense yoga has been part of the teaching of every Indian sect, but it was also the name of a distinct school, which emphasized psychic training as the chief means of salvation.
The basic text of this school is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali; this teacher was traditionally identified with a famous grammarian believed to have lived in the 2nd century B.C., but the sutras in their present form are probably several centuries later.
Statement 2: The God of Yoga was not a creator, but an exalted soul which had existed for eternity without ever being enmeshed in matter.
He was specially symbolized in the sacred syllable OM, which in the Yoga school was much revered, as giving insight into the sublime purity of the soul and thus aiding meditation.
The metaphysical ideas of the Yoga school were originally closely akin to those of
Sankhya, but they differed in that they brought a deity into the picture.
The course of training of the yogi was divided into eight stages including self- control, meditation, breath control, asanas etc.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: C
 Statement 1: Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. While the overall cycle is similar to that of land, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through precipitation, runoff, or as
N2 from the atmosphere
Statement 2: Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria.
Statement 3: Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing etc.
Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone.

b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 Statement 1: Akbar introduced a number of social and educational reforms. He stopped sail, the burning of a widow, unless she herself, of her own free will, persistently desired it. Widows of tender age who had not shared the bed with their husbands were not to be burnt at all.
Statement 2: Widow Remarriage was also legalised. Akbar was against anyone having more than one wife unless the first wife was barren. The age of marriage was raised to 14 for girls and 16 for boys
Statement 3: The sale of wines and spirits was restricted

89 Which of the following is/are the advantages of the minimum tillage system of soil conservation?
1.  Seed germination is higher with minimum tillage system
2.  Less nitrogen has to be added as rate of decomposition of organic matter becomes very fast.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
Conservation tillage is any method of soil cultivation that leaves the previous year's crop residue (such as corn stalks or wheat stubble) on fields before and after planting the next crop, to reduce soil erosion and runoff.
In conventional tillage, energy is often wasted and sometimes, soil structure is destroyed. Recently considerable changes have taken place in tillage practices and several new concepts have been introduced namely, minimum tillage, zero tillage, stubble mulch tillage
Minimum tillage is aimed at reducing tillage to the minimum necessary for ensuring a good seedbed, rapid germination, a satisfactory stand and favourable growing conditions
 Advantages of minimum tillage:
Improved soil conditions due to decomposition of plant residues in situ; Higher infiltration caused by the vegetation present on the soil and channels formed by the decomposition of dead roots;
Less resistance to root growth due to improved structure;
Less soil compaction by the reduced movement of heavy tillage vehicles and less soil erosion compared to conventional tillage
Disadvantages of minimum tillage
Seed germination is lower with minimum tillage.
In minimum tillage, more nitrogen has to be added as rate of decomposition of organic matter is slow.
Nodulation is affected in some leguminous crops like peas and broad beans

92 Which of the following is/are related to generation of Bio-energy?
1.  Pyrolysation
2.  Atmospheric and high pressure gasification
3.  Bio-methanation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Bioenergy is energy derived from the conversion of biomass where biomass may be used directly as fuel, or processed into liquids and gases.
Traditional biomass use refers to the use of wood, charcoal, agricultural resides and animal dung for cooking and heating in the residential sector. It tends to have very low conversion efficiency (10% to 20%) and often unsustainable supply.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has proposed to take up focused
RD&D projects in the area of bio-energy resource identification and biomass conversion to energy through combustion, pyrolysation, atmospheric and high pressure gasification, plasma, bio-methanation and Biogas.
In favourable circumstances, producing energy from biomass can be cost competitive today, in particular heat.
However, in many cases, economic incentives are currently needed to off-set cost differences between bioenergy and fossil fuel-generated electricity and heat. Such support is justified by the environmental, energy security and socio-economic advantages associated with sustainable bioenergy.

 Statement 1: We could not take full advantage of growing international trade due to our weakness in the naval field. The Turkish and Mughal ruling classes had no traditions of connection with the sea.
While the Mughals were quick to recognise the importance of foreign trade and for that reason, gave patronage and support to the European trading companies, they had little understanding of the importance of naval power in the economic development of a nation.
Statement 2: India's lagging behind in the field of naval power was a reflection of its growing backwardness in the field of science and technology all round. Even the mechanical clock which brought together all the European inventions in the field of dynamics was not known in India during the seventeenth century.
Statement 3: The superiority of the Europeans in the field of artillery was freely acknowledged. Even where Indian craftsmen were able to copy European developments for example in the field of ship-building- little ability to innovate was displayed

2.  The World Bank President is appointed by the majority shareholders of the bank from nominees of all nationalities on rotation basis.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Statement 1: The World Bank is led by a Board of Governors, made up of a representative for each of the 185 shareholder countries of the Bank. The Board of Governors serves as the policy-making body for the Bank. Because it only meets once a year, the Board of Governors elects a 24-person Board of Directors (also called Executive Directors) which meets bi-weekly
Statement 2: The President of the World Bank is responsible for the overall management of the Bank, and s/he serves as the Chair of the Bank's Board of Directors. The president holds a five-year, renewable term.
There is a long-standing, informal agreement dating from the establishment of the World Bank in 1944 that its president will be a United States national, while the managing director of the International Monetary Fund will be a European national. Therefore, the past ten Bank presidents have been American. There has never been a female Bank president.
For the selection of the President, the Board of Directors must approve the nominee by a supermajority of 85%.
The voting power of each member is based on its share of contributions to the
Bank, which is expressed as a percentage of the total of votes held by all of the shareholders.
The US is the largest shareholder in the Bank with 16.41% of the votes. The voting weight of the US gives it the ability to block a supermajority decision The five largest shareholders appoint an executive director, while other member countries are represented by elected executive directors
