1 In a cricket tournament conducted by ICC, before the beginning of quarter finals, the sum of the Net Run Rates (NRR) of all participating teams will be equal to
a)  Average run rate of all participating teams
b)  Zero
c)  Can't be ascertained without further information
d)  Mean of the run rates of the teams scoring the highest and lowest in the tournament
Answer: B
  Net Run Rate (NRR) has become the preferred method of breaking ties in multi-team one-day international tournaments.
A team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.
In the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.
For e.g. if India defeats Australia by scoring 250 in 50 overs as against a target of
244 in 50 overs, India's run rate will be + (250-244)/50 = +0.12. Australia's will be its exact opposite, i.e. -0.12.
Repeat the same process for all participating teams and we will get zero on adding all run rates.
You can also see the following example (image from the link below) from the ongoing IPL 2016. Add the Net Run rates and you will get zero.

2 Consider the following statements about the role of media in elections.
1.  All recognised National and State parties are allowed free access to the state owned electronic media scale for their campaigns for a certain duration during elections.
2.  Media persons are given special passes to enter polling stations to cover the poll process and the counting halls during the actual counting of votes.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: By Election Commission, all recognised National and State parties have been allowed free access to the state owned electronic media-AIR and Doordarshan- on an extensive scale for their campaigns during elections.
The total free time allocated extends over 122 hours on the state owned Television and Radio channels. This is allocated equitably by combining a base limit and additional time linked to poll performance of the party in recent election.
Statement 2: After the polling has finished, the votes are counted under the supervision of Returning Officers and Observers appointed by the Election
Commission.
n order to bring as much transparency as possible to the electoral process, the media are encouraged and provided with facilities to cover the election (including the actual counting of votes), although subject to maintaining the secrecy of the vote.

3 "Meerut Thesis, 1936" of the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) is related to
a)  An effective armed resurgence against the British can be strategically planned from Meerut.
b)  Developing leadership of revolutionary socialism within the Congress
c)  Weakening the Imperial Legislative Councils by repeated by-elections
d)  Joining all princely states in the freedom movement who have rebelled in the past against the British
Answer: B
Initially, the task of CSP was interpreted as the displacement of the existing leadership in Congress, which was declared to be incapable of developing the struggle of the masses to a higher level.
The CSP was to develop as the nucleus of the alternative socialist leadership of the
Congress.
As the Meerut Thesis of the CSP put it in 1935, the task was to 'wean the anti- imperialist elements in the Congress away from its present bourgeois leadership and to bring them under the leadership of revolutionary socialism.
This perspective was, however, soon found to be unrealistic and was abandoned in favour of a 'composite' leadership in which socialists would be taken into the leadership at all levels.

4 Scientists have recently discovered a rare triple-star system named KELT-4Ab with a gas giant planet similar in size to Jupiter. The centre of gravity of any such triple star system must lie at the
a)  Centre of the largest star of the triple star system
b)  Centre of the orbit of the smallest star of the triple star system
c)  Geometrical centre of the triple star system
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
Centre of gravity is a point from which the weight of a body or system may be considered to act.
Each star in a triple star system will revolve around the centre of gravity of the system.
The centre of gravity can lie anywhere depending on the mass and distance of stars from each other. So, none of the options (a), (b) or (c) is correct.
It is generally seen that for a triple star system to be stable, two stars form a binary (two) star system revolving around one another, and the third star orbits this pair at a distance much larger than that of the binary orbit.
The reason for this is that if the inner and outer orbits are comparable in size, the system may become dynamically unstable, leading to a star being ejected from the system.

2.  The executive power of a state extends to the scheduled areas therein.
3.  The governor is empowered to direct that any particular act of Parliament or the state legislature does not apply to a scheduled area.
4.  The Constitution requires the president to appoint a commission to report on the administration of the scheduled areas.
5.  The Union Government has no responsibility for the administration of these areas.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  3 and 4 only
b)  1, 2, 3 and 4 only
c)  1, 2 and 5 only
d)  1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
Answer: B
 Statement 5: 'The scheduled areas are treated differently from the other areas in the country because they are inhabited by 'aboriginals' who are socially and economically rather backward, and special efforts need to be made to improve their condition.
Therefore, the whole of the normal administrative machinery operating in a state is not extended to the scheduled areas and the Central government has somewhat greater responsibility for these areas.
Statement 1: He can also increase or decrease its area, alter its boundary lines, rescind such designation or make fresh orders for such redesignation on an area in consultation with the governor of the state concerned.
Statement 2: Also, the governor has a special responsibility regarding such areas. He has to submit a report to the president regarding the administration of such areas, annually or whenever so required by the president.
Statement 3: He can declare that such laws do not apply to a scheduled area or apply with specified modifications and exceptions. He can also make regulations for the peace and good government of a scheduled area after consulting the tribes advisory council.
Statement 4: The Constitution requires the president to appoint a commission to report on the administration of the scheduled areas and the welfare of the scheduled tribes in the states.
He can appoint such a commission at any time but compulsorily after ten years of
the commencement of the Constitution. Hence, a commission was appointed in 1960 and later in 2002.

6 Which of the following statements about the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is

enable auto-debit.
It is Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana that covers accidental insurance. So, (c)
is wrong.
Provision for pension is in Atal pension Yojana. So, (d) is also incorrect.

7 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): The tribal areas in the four states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and
Mizoram fall outside the executive authority of the state concerned.
2.  Reason (R): They have been constituted as autonomous districts under the Sixth
Schedule of the Constitution of India.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
d)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
Answer: C
The governor is empowered to organise and re-organise the autonomous districts. Thus, he can increase or decrease their areas or change their names or
define their boundaries and so on.
If there are different tribes in an autonomous district, the governor can divide the district into several autonomous regions.
The district and regional councils administer the areas under their jurisdiction. They can make laws on certain specified matters like land, forests, canal water, shifting cultivation, village administration, inheritance of property, marriage and divorce, social customs and so on. But all such laws require the assent of the governor.
The acts of Parliament or the state legislature do not apply to autonomous districts and autonomous regions or apply with specified modifications and exceptions.

8 How is GDP deflator different from the Consumer Price Index (CPI)?
1.  GDP deflator takes into account all goods and services unlike CPI which takes only representative goods.
2.  GDP deflator does not include prices of imported goods unlike CPI.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
CPI (and analogously WPI) may differ from GDP deflator because
The goods purchased by consumers do not represent all the goods which are produced in a country. GDP deflator takes into account all such goods and services.
CPI includes prices of goods consumed by the representative consumer, hence it includes prices of imported goods. GDP deflator does not include prices of imported goods.
The weights are constant in CPI - but they differ according to production level of each good in GDP deflator.

9 How can arbitrage in foreign currencies be discouraged?
a)  By levying a high transaction cost in purchase and selling of currencies
b)  By floating all currencies without intervention by a Central monetary authority
c)  Maintaining a large forex reserve
d)  Discouraging foreign investment in the host country
Answer: A
 Arbitrage is the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.
Suppose $1= Rs. 50, $1 = 2 Euros and 1 Euro = Rs. 10.
You can buy 2 Euros by spending just Rs. 20 and exchange it for a Dollar which is actually valued at Rs. 50, thus making a profit of Rs. 30.
If the difference in the rates were more than those transaction costs, profits could be made through arbitrage. But, if suppose transaction cost was Rs. 30 per transaction, arbitrage would be discouraged as there is no profit.

 Gradually, some of these union territories have been elevated to statehood. Thus, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Goa, which are states today were formerly union territories.
On the other hand, the territories that were acquired from the Portuguese (Goa, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli) and the French (Puducherry) were constituted as the union territories.

Besides, tiger population is also found in countries like China, Myanmar and Laos
PDR.
The increase in the population can be attributed to multiple factors including increase in tiger populations in India, Russia, Nepal and Bhutan, improved surveys and enhanced protection and conservation efforts.
Further, the collective support of government of different countries, local communities and law enforcement agencies to WWF in its goal of zero tolerance for tiger poaching across Asia also has led to increase in tiger population.

2.  Provides for flexible inflation targeting by the RBI Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
The objective of monetary policy framework is to primarily maintain price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth.
As per the agreement, RBI would set the policy interest rates and would aim to bring inflation below 6 per cent by January 2016 and within 4 per cent with a band of (+/-)
2 per cent for 2016-17 and all subsequent years (flexible inflation targeting).
The RBI would have to give an explanation in the form of a report to the Central Government, if it failed to reach the specified inflation targets. Further, RBI is mandated to publish a Monetary Policy Report every six months, explaining the sources of inflation and the forecasts of inflation for the coming period of six to eighteen months.

26 Saudi Arabia and Egypt have decided to build bridge connecting each other over the
Red Sea to boost trade and commerce. It is postulated that the joint bridge planned over the
Red Sea will be at the entrance of the
a)  Gulf of Aqaba
b)  Persian Gulf
c)  Gulf of Oman
d)  Gulf of Aden
Answer: A
 You can eliminate for the right option easily if you know the map of
Middle East. It is a map based question.
Persian Gulf can't be the answer as it is between Saudi and Iran.
Gulf of Oman can't be the answer as Oman lies in the South-eastern direction of
Saudi.
Gulf of Aden is near Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia. So, this leaves only option (a)
as the right answer.
See the map below.

30 Sacred groves found in Khasi and Jaintia hills in Meghalaya are an example of
a)  In situ conservation
b)  Ex situ conservation
c)  Exotic conservation
d)  Artificial regeneration
Answer: A
When we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem, its biodiversity at all levels is protected. This approach is called in situ (on site) conservation.
In India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries.
In many cultures, tracts of forest were set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection.
Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan, Western Ghat regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas of Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges for a large number of threatened plants and animals.

41 'Insider trading' has been often in news and is illegal in most nations. Why is it considered illegal?
1.  The ones trading have access to valuable non-public information about a corporation.
2.  It is equivalent to speculation.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Statement 1: When insiders, e.g. key employees or executives who have access to the strategic information about the company, use the same for trading in the company's stocks or securities, it is called insider trading and is highly discouraged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to promote fair trading
in the market for the benefit of the common investor.
However, in certain cases if the information has been made public, in a way that all concerned investors have access to it, that will not be a case of illegal insider trading.
Statement 2: Speculation is the practice of engaging in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from fluctuations in the market value of a tradable good. It is not illegal. Also, insider trading can be more than speculation and can even be a genuine investment.
For e.g. an employee knows (confidentially) that his company's plans of acquiring another company will raise its stock price, and hence he invests in the stocks to gain from the rise in price.

Statement 2: Trading commodity futures and options is a volatile, complex and risky venture that is rarely suitable for individual investors or "retail customers". Other reasons are:
Most participants in the futures markets are commercial or institutional commodities producers or consumers
Most participants are "hedgers" who trade futures to maximize the value of their assets, and to reduce the risk of financial losses from price changes Other participants are "speculators" who attempt to profit from price changes in futures contracts.

53 The Open Market Sale Scheme of Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies helps achieve which of the following objective(s)?
1.  Keeping food inflation under check
2.  Controlling prices of food grains during off season
3.  Increasing supply of food grains in deficit areas
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Due to an open ended procurement policy of food grains providing price support to every farmer, who wants to sell his produce to the Government at MSP,
usually Government agencies end up in procuring more food grains.
This has led to accumulation of excess stock under central pool as against the required buffer norms. As excess stock involve carrying cost which adds to the burden of food subsidy on the Government, it is necessary that they are liquidated from time to time either through sale in the open domestic market or through exports.
Liquidation of excess stocks under Open Market Sale Scheme-Domestic (OMSS-D) also helps in keeping food inflation under check (due to supply-emand mismatch) and controlling prices of food grains during off season, especially in the deficit areas.

58 A night vision apparatus works on the basis of
a)  Sensing micro-waves emitted by the object
b)  Sensing the heat patterns or infra-red waves emitted by the object
c)  Measuring the reflection of radio waves from the object
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
 With the proper night-vision equipment, you can see a person standing over 200 yards (183 m) away on a moonless, cloudy night.
Night vision can work in two very different ways, depending on the technology used.
Image enhancement - This works by collecting the tiny amounts of light, including the lower portion of the infrared light spectrum, that are present but may be imperceptible to our eyes, and amplifying it to the point that we can easily observe the image.
Thermal imaging - This technology operates by capturing the upper portion of the infrared light spectrum, which is emitted as heat by objects instead of simply reflected as light. Hotter objects, such as warm bodies, emit more of this light than cooler objects like trees or buildings.

Answer: A
 Since demand for domestic exports will increase in international market, it will raise producer's income in the country and thus domestic aggregate demand.
Conversely, a currency appreciation would reduce net exports and, therefore, decrease aggregate demand.
However, we must note that international trade patterns take time to respond to changes in exchange rates.
A considerable period of time may elapse before any improvement in net exports is apparent.

64 Along with the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme, the government also launched the "Sukanya Samriddhi Account" programme. Under the Sukanya Samriddhi Account programme
1.  A parent can open an account in the name of the girl child right after the completion of her secondary education.
2.  The account can be opened both in public as well as private sector banks.
3.  The government will contribute a certain sum annually to the account to which additional contributions can be made by parents.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: C
 The scheme aims to ensure a bright future for the girl children by facilitating their education and marriage expenses.
Under the scheme, a parent or legal guardian can open an account in the name of the girl child until she attains the age of ten years. So, 1 is wrong.
The minimum deposit that needs to be made by the guardian every year is Rs
1,000, which will earn a handsome interest rate compounded annually. So, 3 is also wrong.
The account will be valid for 21 years from the date of opening, after which it will mature and the money will be paid to the girl child in whose name the account had been opened.
If the account is not closed after maturity, the balance amount will continue to earn interest as specified for the scheme from time to time. The account will also automatically close if the girl child gets married before the completion of the tenure of 21 years.

67 The Agaria community of Gujarat are
a)  Salt pan workers of the Rann of Kutch
b)  Goldsmiths who settled from the North-east during British rule
c)  Indigenous tribes who have been displaced to Pakistan
d)  The wood pickers of Pavagadh hill who will now be adopted by the
UNESCO heritage programme
Answer: A
 Throughout their lives, members of the Agariya community work tirelessly in the fields of the Rann of Kutch, where they "grow" salt, taking care of almost 75 per cent of the country's demand.
As per an article published in The Hindu, "But fulfilling India's salt needs comes at a price, as the salt pan workers face problems such as abnormally thin legs which become so stiff that even after death, they do not burn in the funeral pyre.
But despite working hard in harsh climatic conditions with day temperatures rising to 40 degrees and nights witnessing 5 degree Celsius temperature, the Agariyas earn a meagre Rs 60 per ton.
One of the poorest communities of India, Agariyas get their skin burnt due to continuous exposure to highly saturated salt and their children rarely go to school."

71 Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun varies with
a)  Shape of its orbit
b)  It remains constant throughout the orbit.
c)  Earth's distance from the Sun
d)  Both (a) and (c)
Answer: D
 As the earth moves close to the Sun, its orbital velocity increases, and decreases as it goes farther from the Sun.
Based on Kepler's three laws of motion (9th standard physics), you will know that in an elliptical orbit, a body will trace equal orbital area in equal intervals of time. So, depending on the shape of the orbit, the velocity of earth will vary.

72 The distribution of natural resources on earth is affected by which of the following physical factors?
1.  Terrain
2.  Altitude
3.  Climate
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
Low latitudes (latitudes close to the equator) receive more of the sun's energy and much precipitation, while higher latitudes (latitudes closer to the poles) receive less of the sun's energy and too little precipitation.
The temperate deciduous forest biome provides a more moderate climate, along with fertile soil, timber, and abundant wildlife.
The plains offer flat landscapes and fertile soil for growing crops, while steep mountains and dry deserts are more difficult areas.
Hence, all the statements will be correct.

73 Consider the following statements.
1.  Although CITES is legally binding on the parties it does not take the place of national laws.
2.  CITES includes only those wild animals species threatened with extinction.
3.  The Conference of the Parties (CoP) is the supreme decision-making body of the
Convention.
4.  CITES in funded entirely by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

d)  1, 3 and 4 only
Answer: C
Statement 1: CITES is an international agreement to which States (countries) adhere voluntarily. States that have agreed to be bound by the Convention ('joined' CITES) are known as Parties.
Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties - in other words they have to implement the Convention - it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework to be respected by each Party, which has to adopt its own domestic legislation to ensure that CITES is implemented at the national level.
Statement 2: Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.
Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.
Statement 4: It is financed from the CITES Trust Fund. This Trust Fund is replenished from contributions from the Parties to the Convention based on the United Nations scale of assessment, adjusted to take account of the fact that not all members of the United Nations are Parties to the Convention.

5.  It takes a U-turn into India on reaching Namcha Barwa.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1, 2, 3 and 4 only
b)  2, 3 and 5 only
c)  1, 4 and 5 only
d)  1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
Answer: D
 It flows eastwards parallel to the Himalayas. On reaching the Namcha Barwa (7757 m), it takes a 'U' turn and enters India in Arunachal Pradesh through a gorge.
Here, it is called the Dihang and it is joined by the Dibang, the Lohit, the Kenula and many other tributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam.
In Tibet the river carries a smaller volume of water and less silt as it is a cold and a dry area.
In India it passes through a region of high rainfall. Here the river carries a large volume of water and considerable amount of silt.
The Brahmaputra has a braided channel in its entire length in Assam and forms many riverine islands.

75 Why most of the world's deserts are located in the western margins of continents in the subtropics?
1.  Due to effect of cold currents
2.  Due to dry off shore Trade Winds
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Statement 1: The presence of cold ocean currents along the western shores of continents (in the subtropics) leads to the development of high pressure over the water surface. This high pressure leads to subsidence of air hinder cloud formation.
Statement 2: The trade winds blow in the North Easterly direction in the northern hemisphere while they blow in the South Easterly direction in the southern hemisphere. As such they blow over land and very dry thus no possibility of causing precipitation.

77 Thunderstorms can be caused by
1.  Intense convection on moist hot days
2.  Cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and lightning
3.  Presence of polar fronts
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: A
  Thunderstorms are caused by intense convection on moist hot days. A thunderstorm is a well-grown cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and lightening.
When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. If there is insufficient moisture, a thunderstorm can generate duststorms.
A thunderstorm is characterised by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to greater height. This causes precipitation. Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and the rain.
Tornadoes: From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force, with very low pressure at the centre, causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is called a tornado. Tornadoes generally occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called water sprouts.

78 Which of the following were some of features of the Mansabdari system introduced by
Akbar?
1.  The mansabdars got their salaries from the emperor and paid themselves the salaries to their troops.
2.  Caste system prevailed in the mansabdari system.
3.  The property of a mansabdar was confiscated after his death which made them spend lavishly during their lifetime.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 These proved to be some of the most important demerits of the
Mansabdari system.
Statement 1: This made the troops more loyal to the mansabdars than to the king. Statement 2: Discouraged unity among castes and promoted factionalism within the
system.
Statement 3: Dishonest mansabdars and officials used to ally together during inspection, borrowed horses from one another and showed their full quota.
Since the property of a mansabdar was confiscated after his death, he used to spend it lavishly during his lifetime. This made the nobles luxurious and it led to their moral degradation which had an adverse effect on their efficiency.

79 Other than water vapour, the largest concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere is
a)  Methane
b)  Ozone
c)  Carbon dioxide
d)  Chlorofluorocarbons
Answer: C
 Refer to the image or the link
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Impacts_on_the_overall_greenhous
e_effect)
 More important than the concentration is the warming potential of a
GHG.
The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is affected by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause.
For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 72 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime.
On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation.

81 'Hot Spots' within the earth help produce Geothermal Energy. What are these 'Hot
Spots'?
a)  Areas of intense pressure inside the mantle
b)  Region in crust where hot molten rocks are trapped
c)  Regions of high volcanism on earth's surface
d)  Areas of intense magnetic activity within the upper mantle
Answer: B
 Due to geological changes, molten rocks formed in the deeper hot regions of earth's crust are pushed upward and trapped in certain regions called 'hot spots'.
When underground water comes in contact with the hot spot, steam is generated. Sometimes hot water from that region finds outlets at the surface. Such outlets are known as hot springs.
The steam trapped in rocks is routed through a pipe to a turbine and used to generate electricity. The cost of production would not be much, but there are very few commercially viable sites where such energy can be exploited.
There are number of power plants based on geothermal energy operational in New
Zealand and United States of America.

82 Who was the first person to give rules to compute with zero?
a)  Aryabhatta
b)  Brahmagupta
c)  Pingala
d)  Bhaskara
Answer: B
  The rules governing the use of zero appeared for the first time in the Brahmasputha Siddhanta (7th century).
This work considers not only zero, but negative numbers, and the algebraic rules for the elementary operations of arithmetic with such numbers.
In some instances, his rules differ from the modern standard, specifically the definition of the value of zero divided by zero as zero.
Brahmagupta established the basic mathematical rules for dealing with zero (1 + 0 =
1; 1 - 0 = 1; and 1 x 0 = 0), although his understanding of division by zero was incomplete (he thought that 1

89 Phytoplankton supporting large standing crop (biomass) of zooplankton generally shows an inverted biomass pyramid in a pond ecosystem. Why?
1.  Phytoplankton cells are relatively short-lived as compared to zooplanktons.
2.  Productivity of zooplankton is greater than that of phytoplankton.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Phytoplankton (or single-celled algae) typically maintain a similar biomass as the small animals (called zooplankton) that feed upon these microscopic plants.
However, the phytoplankton cells are relatively short-lived, and their biomass is regenerated quickly because of the high productivity of these microorganisms. So, 1 is correct.
In contrast, the herbivorous zooplankton are longer lived, and they are much less productive than the phytoplankton. So, 2 is wrong.
Consequently, the productivity of the phytoplankton is much larger than that of the zooplankton, even though at any particular time their biomasses may be similar.
In other cases of inverted pyramids, the weight of producers can be much smaller than that of consumers.

92 Why was the Communal Award of 1932 severely opposed by the leaders of the national freedom struggle?
a)  The Award allotted to each minority a number of seats in the legislatures to be elected on the basis of a separate electorate.
b)  The Award declared the Depressed Classes to be a minority community.
c)  The Award removed reservations for persons with disability in government jobs.
d)  Both (a) and (b)
Answer: D
 The British policy of 'Divide and Rule' found another expression in the announcement of the Communal Award in 1932.
The Award allotted to each minority a number of seats in the legislatures to be elected on the basis of a separate electorate that is Muslims would be elected only by Muslims and Sikhs only by Sikhs, and so on.
Muslims, Sikhs and Christians had already been treated as minorities. The Award declared the Depressed Classes (Scheduled Castes of today) also to be a minority community entitled to separate electorate and thus separated them from the rest of the Hindus.
The Congress was opposed to a separate electorate for Muslims, Sikhs and
'Christians as it encouraged the communal notion that they formed separate groups or communities having interests different from the general body of Indians.

Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
Statement 1: The Parliament can make laws on any subject of the
three lists (including the State List) for the union territories.
This power of Parliament also extends to Puducherry and Delhi, which have their own local legislatures.
This means that, the legislative power of Parliament for the union territories on subjects of the State List remain unaffected even after establishing a local legislature for them.
Statement 2: But, the legislative assembly of Puducherry can also make laws on any subject of the State List and the Concurrent List.
Similarly, the legislative assembly of Delhi can make laws on any subject of the
State List (except public order, police and land) and the Concurrent List.

96 In 1934, why did Gandhiji resign from Congress party membership?
a)  Difference of opinion on suitable candidate for Presidency of the Indian
National Congress (INC)
b)  He wanted to quit active political life.
c)  To pursue his own vision of an independent India by doing constructive work
d)  Excessive interference of the British in the administration of INC
Answer: C
 Gandhiji was convinced that he was out of tune with powerful trends in the Congress.
He felt that a large section of the intelligentsia favoured parliamentary politics with which he was in fundamental disagreement.
Another section of the intelligentsia felt estranged from the Congress because of his emphasis on the spinning wheel as 'the second lung of the nation,' on Harijan work based on a moral and religious approach, and on other items of the constructive programme.
Similarly, the socialist group, whose leader was Jawaharlal, was growing in influence and importance but he had fundamental differences with it. Yet the Socialists felt constrained by the weight of his personality.
He said, "for me to dominate the Congress in spite of these fundamental differences is almost a species of violence which I must refrain from."
Hence, in October 1934, he announced his resignation from the Congress.

99 The Congress ministries in British provinces could not attempt an overhaul of the agrarian structure by completely eliminating the zamindari system. Why?
1.  According to the constitutional structure of the 1935 Act, the provincial Ministries did not have enough powers to do so.
2.  Many landlords from large areas of the country were active participants in the national movement.
Which of the above is/are can be correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: The Congress Ministries could also not touch the existing administrative structure, whose sanctity was guarded by the Viceroy's and Governor's powers.
Statement 2: In large parts of the country, the smaller landlords were active participants in the national movement. This was recognized by most of the leaders of the time. Since Congress represented nearly all classes of society, it was difficult for it to implement such a radical reform.
Finally, the agrarian structure of various parts of India had developed over the centuries and was extremely complex and complicated.. There was not even enough information about its various components - land rights, for instance. The problem of debt and money lending was also integrated with peasant production and livelihood in too complex a manner to be tackled by an easy one-shot solution.

100 The historic detection of gravitational waves will open up new frontier for understanding of universe. Consider the following statements about Gravitational waves (G-waves).
1.  G- Waves can pass through any intervening matter without being scattered significantly.
2.  They can be observed in the merger of two black holes.
3.  All movements of matter in space create G-waves.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  2 only
Answer: A
 Before going through the justification, please go through the entire article at PIB Features of 19th February 2016. It explains everything about G-waves.
http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx
Statement 1: While light from distant stars may be blocked out by interstellar dust, gravitational waves will pass through essentially unimpeded. This feature allows G- Waves to carry information about astronomical phenomena never before observed by humans. With this detection we will be able to turn the Universe into our own laboratory.
Statement 2 and 3: Not all movements create Gravitational waves.
A spinning disk will not radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of conservation of angular momentum.
An isolated non-spinning solid object moving at a constant velocity will not radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of conservation of linear momentum.
But, two objects orbiting each other in a planar orbit such as a planet orbiting the Sun or a binary star system or the merging of two black holes will radiate Gravitational waves!
