1 The Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) would do a detailed study of the Solar activity including its magnetic field to facilitate space weather predictions in the future. The observatory has been situated on an island in the middle of a lake. Why?
a)  Middle of the water body, there will be less turbulence in the air mass and thereby image quality and seeing will be improved
b)  In the Island, the cosmic radiation will be comparatively lesser than that on land
c)  Measurement of magnetic field near water body is enhanced as water molecules have zero magnetism, whereas land particles may have some magnetism
d)  There will be less interference from electromagnetic radiation from
telecommunications towers and other magnetic objects
Answer: A
The USO is situated on an island in the middle of the Lake Fatehsagar of Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. The sky conditions at Udaipur are quite favourable for solar observations. The large water body surrounding the telescopes decreases the amount of heating of the surface layers. This decreases the turbulence in the air mass and thereby improves the image quality and seeing.
The main objective of obtaining the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of solar photospheric and chromospheric activity is to understand the various dynamic phenomena occurring on the surface of the Sun.

2 What do you understand by the term 'New International economic order (NIEO)' of the
1970s?
a)  It was a call by developed nations to give equal space to newly decolonized nations in global economic assistance.
b)  It was a movement by International Economic Association (IEa) to stop the exploitation of third world countries by MNCs.
c)  It was a set of proposals by African nations to stop colonial conquest and economic exploitation.
d)  It was a call by some developing nations for revision of the international
economic system in favour of Third World countries.
Answer: D
The New International Economic Order (NIEO) was a set of proposals put forward during the 1970s by some developing countries through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to promote their interests by improving their terms of trade, increasing development assistance, developed- country tariff reductions, and other means.
It was meant to be a revision of the international economic system in favour of Third World countries, replacing the Bretton Woods system, which had benefited the leading states that had created it- especially the United States.

3 Consider the following about Snow Leopard.
1.  It is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
2.  It is the National Heritage Animal of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
3.  2015 has been designated as the International Year of the Snow Leopard in selected countries.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
In a world first event, in October 2013, leaders in the governments of all
12 snow leopard range countries came together at the Global Snow Leopard Forum initiated by the President of Kyrgyz Republic, Mr Almazbek Atambayev.
At that meeting in the Kyrgyz Republic's capital, Bishkek, the 12 countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat it lives in, is too precious to let disappear.
To help spread the word amongst the people, government authorities and conservation groups in each country, designated 2015 as International Year of the Snow Leopard in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

4 What differentiates a 'nation-state' from a 'state'?
a)  A nation-state does not have a centralized authority as a state.
b)  A state is a mix of several ethnicities and communities unlike a nation-state.
c)  A nation-state does not have a constitution unlike a state.
d)  State is only a legal/political entity, whereas nation-state is a legal/political
entity as well as a cultural/social entity.
Answer: D
 USSR was a nation-state. Authority was centralized in it. So, (a) is wrong. A nation-state is a mix of several ethnicities, a state need NOT be. So, (b) is wrong. Both nation-states (e.g. USA, Canada) and states (e.g. India) can have constitution. So, (c) is wrong.
A nation refers only to a socio-cultural entity, a union of people sharing who can identify culturally and linguistically. This concept does not necessarily consider formal political unions.
A state refers to a legal/political entity that is comprised of the following: a) a permanent population; b) a defined territory; c) a government ; and d) the capacity
to enter into relations with other states. Combination of both is known as a nation-state. 

5 Consider the following about State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs).
1.  It regulates commercial utilization of biological resources of India.
2.  It is responsible for the conservation of folk varieties and cultivars in forests.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
The Biological Diversity Act 2002covers conservation, use of biological resources and associated knowledge occurring in India for commercial or research purposes or for the purposes of bio-survey and bio-utilisation.
It establishes, NBA, SSBs and local level bodies.
Statement 2 is done by local level Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs)
constituted under the Biological Diversity Act (2002).
You read more about all the functions of NBA and the Act here.

6 The Bretton Woods institutions were established with which of the following objectives?
1.  Finance post-world war II reconstruction
2.  To deal with external surpluses and deficits of member nations
3.  To ensure full employment in developed countries
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 at the UN monetary and financial Conference held in
1944, at Bretton Woods, USA, it was decided to establish IMF and International
Bank for reconstruction and Development (World Bank).
IMF would deal with external surpluses and deficits of member nations. IBRD
would setup to finance post-war reconstruction. So, 1 and 2 is correct.
The goal of full employment is dealt with national governments. So, 3 is wrong.

7 Which of the following are the 'disadvantages' of inland waterways as compared to roadways?
1.  It is less fuel efficient.
2.  Cost of developing waterways is generally more than roadways.
3.  Overall transportation cost is generally more.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 The IWT advantages are several and disadvantages are few. Among all the transport modes, it is the least capital-intensive, is environment- friendly, can supplement rail and road transport, help in the decongestion of roads, is best suited to carry over-dimensional cargo (ODC), requires minimum. So, 2 is wrong.
Transportation costs are lesser than roadways. So, 3 is wrong.
Both IWT and coastal shipping are highly fuel efficient when compared to roadways. So, 1 is wrong.
Rivers, canals and lakes can be used as IWT.
For the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-2017), IWT has been allocated R10,500 crore, substantially more than the previous Plan periods. A World Bank study on IWT has shown that 'in many instances, these advantages can be gained with little or no improvement to existing waterways. In others, a modest level of complementary investment can significantly increase usability'.

8 Why is the gravitational force of moon lesser than earth?
1.  Moon has no atmosphere.
2.  Moon spins at a slower rate than earth.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
This is one more question based on the concept of weight and gravity.
The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis. The earth (despite being larger) takes only 24 hours to rotate on its axis. So, clearly earth rotates faster than moon.
Moon's gravity has no relation with its rotation. But, yes, the weight of a body on moon will be affected by Moon's rotation.
This is because, your weight also depends on the centrifugal force exerted due to the rotation of the body.
W = G - Centrifugal force

9 If RBI changes the Repo rate, it also changes which of the following monetary policy tools?
1.  Reverse Repo rate
2.  Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)

3.  Cash Reserve ratio (CRR)
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: D
The rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks is called repo rate. It is an instrument of monetary policy. Whenever banks have any shortage of funds they can borrow from the RBI.
Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks. The difference between both rates is always maintained at 100 basis points (or 1%). So, if repo rate changes, it changes reverse repo also. Hence, 1 is correct and 2 and 3 are wrong. CRR and SLR are fixed separately.

10 If India declares a national war against the Islamic state (ISIS), it must be approved by
a)  Ministry of External Affairs
b)  President of India
c)  Indian Armed Forces
d)  National Security Council
Answer: B
President of India is the chief commander of the Indian armed forces. Any decision to conclude peace or war is finally approved by him.
However, after his approval, the Parliament must also assent to it within a certain period of time.
So, (b) is correct. Others only play an advisory role. Final decision taken by cabinet is forwarded to the President.
The question was made in backdrop of German cabinet approving a mandate offering military assistance to fight against the Islamic State (IS) militant
group in Syria.
Under this mandate Germany could deploy up to 1,200 military personnel to support the international alliance but they won't actively engage in combat missions.

11 Consider the following statements.
1.  In Railways, investment is done by both Central and State governments.
2.  In Civil Aviation, investment is done both by Central government and private sector.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
In railways, only Central government invests. Some services may be outsourced to private parties (e.g. catering). So, 1 is wrong.
In civil aviation, airports are usually built under the PPP model, where both Central government and private parties invest jointly and share the revenues and risks. So, 2 is correct.
In India, railways are under-invested. It accounts for only 5.5% of total plan outlay vis-a-vis 11% in other transport sectors.
Network expansion in Railways has lagged behind capacity addition in the domestic roads sector. So, significant freight share has gone to the roadways (57% of total), instead of more efficient railways.
So, there is a strong case for channeling resources to such transport infrastructure in India given the widely known spillover effects of transport networks to link markets, reduce a variety of costs, boost agglomeration economies, and improve the competitiveness of the economy, especially manufacturing which tends to be logistics-intensive.

12 In India, labour laws generally cover which of the following areas of concern?
1.  Dispute settlement between the labourers and management
2.  Provision for hiring and firing of labour
3.  Provisions regarding payment of wages
4.  Minimum labour qualifications for heavy industries
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  2 and 4 only
b)  1, 2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
For e.g. recently the President assented to the Labour Laws (Gujarat
Amendment) Bill, 2015. It has provisions relating to
Ban strikes: Empowers state government to ban strikes in public utility services
Dispute Settlement: Add provision for out of court settlement between the labourers and management by paying certain fee to the government. Redefine contractors: Amends the definition of contractor to include outsourcing agencies, which in some cases is government itself.
Payment of wages: Mandatory to be paid by cheque instead of cash for establishments employing 20 persons or more.
Empower employers to change nature of jobs of the employees without prior notice.
Hence, all options except 4 are correct. This is because minimum qualifications are not generally regulated by laws except in some cases such as medical schools etc. Instead, specialized bodies (for e.g. ICAI for Ca) regulate minimum qualifications.

13 Which of the following are reason(s) for non-adoption of bio-toilets at a large scale in
India?
1.
2.
It cannot work in cold Himalayan regions.
To maintain the health of bacteria, bio-toilets need to be maintained regularly. Which of the above is/are true?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
They can be used in Himalayan Regions, glaciers and even sea ports. So, 1 is incorrect.
Bio-toilets are generally maintenance free and have a life of upto 50 years at once. This is why they are being installed at large scale in railways. So, 2 is also incorrect.

14 Consider the following about Bihu dance.
1.  It is performed by both young men and women.
2.  Hand and leg movement is slow as dance is performed on grass plates.
3.  The dance is performed to wish for good rains and crops.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
 Performed in the state of Assam on Bihu festival, it is characterized by brisk dance steps,and rapid hand movement. Dancers (both genders) wear traditionally colorful Assamese clothing. So, 1 is correct and 2 is incorrect.
The dance takes several forms among the different northeast Indian groups, e.g. "Deori Bihu dance", "Mising Bihu dance" etc. However, the underlying goal of the dance remains the same: to express the desire to feel both pain and happiness.
Bihu generally marks the end of the harvest season. So, 3 is wrong.

15 Funds under the PM Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY) can be utilized for
1.  Improving physical infrastructure of the region
2.  Subsidizing economically non-viable mining units
3.  Enhancing quality of environment in mining districts
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
The PMKKKY fund is obtained after imposing royalty payments on the miners. So, the funds will not be used to subsidize mining company or units. It will be used exclusively for the welfare of the citizens affected by mining. So, statement 2 is incorrect.
Welfare would involve overall development, i.e. watershed development, reducing pollution, improving health indicators, education etc. So, 1 and 3 are correct.
Areas of focus:
High priority areas like drinking water supply, health care, sanitation, education, skill development, women and child care, welfare of aged and disabled people, skill development and environment conservation will get at least 60 % share of the funds.
For creating a supportive and conducive living environment, balance funds will be spent on making roads, bridges, railways, waterways projects, irrigation and alternative energy sources.
About District Mineral Foundations (DMFs):
The Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Act,
2015, mandated the setting up of District Mineral Foundations (DMFs) in all districts in the country affected by mining related operations.

16 Why are whales and dolphins mammals and not most other fishes?
1.  Like mammals, whales and dolphins breathe air through a pair of lungs.
2.  Like most mammals, they are cold-blooded.
3.  Like most mammals, they give birth to live young ones.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: C
Mammals are warm-blooded animals with four-chambered hearts. They have mammary glands for the production of milk to nourish their young. Their
skin has hairs as well as sweat and oil glands.
Most mammals familiar to us produce live young ones. However, a few of them, like the platypus and the echidna lay eggs, and some, like kangaroos give birth to very poorly developed young ones.
Whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, walruses, and many other marine animals are mammals, not fish. Apart from the options mentioned above, they have fur (although it is very sparse on their body) and they provide milk for their young.

17 Russia has recently imposed economic sanctions against Turkey on the issue of
a)  Turkey has shot down a Russian aircraft which entered its territory
b)  Turkey supporting the Islamic State (ISIS) in its territory
c)  Turkey was suspected to be involved in the development of chemical weapons
d)  Turkey was suspected to have instigated a coup in the Ukrainian region
Answer: A
NATO member Turkey recently in November 2015 had shot down Russian Sukhoi 24 (Su-24) warplane escalating crisis in bilateral relations of both countries.
Turkey has claimed that the Russian jet was shot down after it had crossed into its airspace and ignored several warnings to change course. However, Russia has furiously denied the claims and demanded an apology and economic compensation from Turkey.
Russian economic sanctions covers Ban on imports from Turkey, work of Turkish companies in Russia and any Turkish nationals working for Russian companies. It also covers end to charter flights between the countries and urges Russian tour operators to refrain from selling tourist packages to Turkey.

20 The apparent flattening of the Sun's disc at sunrise and sunset is due to
1.  Formation of mirage on ground
2.  Halo effect of the Sun
3.  Cloud iridescence
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
The actual reason is atmospheric refraction, which was covered in the last 
A mirage has nothing to do with the flattening of the Sun's discs. So, 1 is incorrect.
A Halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, resulting in a wide variety of colored or white rings, arcs and spots in the sky. It's not the reason for the flattening of the disc. So, 2 is wrong.
Cloud iridescence is the occurrence of colors in a cloud similar to those seen in oil films on puddles, and is similar to irisation. So, 3 is also incorrect.

21 Which of the following are convincing arguments for adopting democracy?
1.  Democratic nations have had a higher economic growth rate historically than dictatorial regimes.
2.  Only democratic nations can become members of the United Nations (UN).
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
Here is the table comparing growth rates in the recent past. There is no evidence that democracies grow faster than dictatorships. In fact, the reverse has
been found to be true. So, 1 is wrong.
Non-democratic nations like Saudi Arabia, Syria are all members of UN. So, even statement 2 is wrong.

22 Artificial satellites and space probes like Mars orbiters generally use which source of energy?
a)  They exploit Dark energy of the outer space
b)  They obtain energy from the microwaves and ultrasonic waves
c)  They harness energy from gravitational waves
d)  They get solar energy from the use of solar cells
Answer: D
Science has not learnt to even understand dark energy. The question of harnessing is distant. So, (a) is incorrect.
Microwaves are a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which are used for communication, not generating energy. So, (c) is incorrect.
Gravitational waves are primordial waves of the Universe. So, (c) is incorrect.
Solar cells, batteries and nuclear cells are some of the sources of energy for artificial satellites and space probes.Solar cells also have other uses. Radio or wireless transmission systems or TV relay stations in remote location use solar cell panels.
Traffic signals are also fitted with solar cells. The solar cell panels are mounted on specially designed inclined roof tops so that more solar energy is incident over it. The domestic use of solar cells is, however, limited due to its high cost.

23 Consider the following about IBSA, an international grouping of India, Brazil and South
Africa.
1.  It originated through the Brasilia declaration.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 4 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1, 3 and 4 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: C
India has hosted three IBSA (founded in 2003) summits, all in New
Delhin in 2008, 2013 and 2015 (planned). So, 2 is wrong.
The main objective of the IBSA Fund (established in 2004) is to benefit other developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Post Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD) countries around the world in partnership with the UN. So, 4 is correct.
This is a good article that compares the role of BRICS and IBSA. We feel a question might come in this year UPSC Mains, or next year Prelims.

24 Coliform bacteria can
1.  Spread Tuberculosis among humans
2.  Act as an indicator of water pollution.
3.  Indicate the presence of natural gas deposits in a certain area
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: B
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), not coliform. So, 1 is incorrect.
Natural gas deposits occur generally with oil. It has nothing to do with coliform bacteria. So, 3 is incorrect.
Coliform bacteria are a commonly used bacterial indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water (e.g. in Ganges water). So, 2 is correct.
Coliforms can be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation; they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm- blooded animals. While coliforms themselves are not normally causes of serious illness, they are easy to culture, and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present.
E. coli), a rod-shaped member of the coliform group. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but some can cause serious illness in humans. Infection symptoms and signs include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and occasionally, fever.

25 In India, the 'Constitution' of political parties must be approved by
a)  The Chief Election Commissioner of India
b)  Election Commission of India in case of national parties, and Chief Secretary of the state in case of state parties
c)  All State Election Commissions in which they fight elections
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
The constitution of political parties defines their composition, governance structures, mandate, vision, mission etc. It serves as an inner check on the party members and cannot be violated. It need not be approved by anybody.
However, if the manifestos issued by the political parties contain something objectionable, an appeal can be filed to the ECI. OR if a registered political party has an objectionable constitution (e.g. seditious content), it can be banned (e.g. Maoist parties) by the government and ECI.

26 Some hybrid varieties of crops are developed to tackle 'biotic and abiotic stresses'. What do you understand by this?
1.  By preventing the plant to biologically choose its own agronomic characteristics
2.  Crop can tackle conditions of greater than normal cold or frost

3.  Making the crop insect-resistant
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: B
 Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production. So, 2 and 3 are correct.
Agronomic characteristics are tallness, dwarfness etc of plants. Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops. Dwarfness is desired in cereals. But, these are not part of biotic and abiotic stresses. So, 1 is incorrect.
 Varieties or strains of crops can be selected by breeding for various useful characteristics such as disease resistance, response to fertilisers, product quality and high yields.
One way of incorporating desirable characters into crop varieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation refers to crossing between genetically dissimilar plants. This crossing may be intervarietal (between different varieties), interspecific (between two different species of the same genus) or intergeneric (between different genera).
Another way of improving the crop is by introducing a gene that would provide the desired characteristic. This results in genetically modified crops.

27 The SEBI-FMC merger will allow Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to
a)  Monitor speculation in stock market
b)  Track and take action against malpractices in commodity futures market
c)  Fine retailers and firms involved in inflating prices due to hoarding
d)  Regulate futuristic mergers of food related corporations in India
Answer: B
Justification SEBI already monitors speculation in stock market. So, (a) is not appropriate answer, given (b).
Fining retailers for hoarding comes under the jurisdiction of local governments. So, (c) is wrong.
SEBI cannot regulate any mergers and acquisitions. It falls under the domain of other regulatory authorities like CCI. So, (d) is also wrong.
 Under the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952, which regulates commodity trading in India, a forward contract is a contract for the actual delivery of goods. On the other hand, a futures contract is one where the buyer can settle the contract in cash as well.
With SEBI-FMC merger, SEBI is set to take over regulation of commodities markets as well. However, it is not comfortable with forward contracts in commodity exchanges. · SEBI's concern stems from two facts:
One, unlike futures contracts, forward contracts are not standardised; Two, there's greater counterparty risk associated with forward contracts.

28 In areas with light soils, crops get adversely affected by drought conditions. Why?
a)  Light soils have less water retention capacity.
b)  Light soils have low iron content.
c)  Light soils cannot be irrigated unlike dense soils.
d)  Light soils change their mineral nutrients composition on dehydrating.
Answer: A
Justification Iron content in the crop will remain the same before and after drought. So, (b) can't be the answer.
Light soils can be as easily irrigated, and in fact more frequently, as dense soils. So, (c) is incorrect.
They don't change mineral nutrient composition on drying. In severe drought, organic matter may however dry up. So, (d) is also incorrect.
 Sandy soils have high proportion of sand and little clay. Also known as light soils, these soils drain quickly after rain or watering, are easy to cultivate and work. They warm up more quickly in spring than clay soils. But on the downside, they dry out quickly and are low in plant nutrients, which are quickly washed out by rain. Sandy soils are often very acidic.

31 Apart from bacteria, which of the following living species may be involved in the nitrogen cycle in our atmosphere?
1.  Animals
2.  Green plants
3.  Humans
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
  Plants generally take up nitrates and nitrites and convert them into amino acids which are used to make proteins.
These proteins and other complex compounds are subsequently consumed by animals.
Once the animal or the plant dies, other bacteria in the soil convert the various compounds of nitrogen back into nitrates and nitrites. A different type of bacteria converts the nitrates and nitrites into elemental nitrogen.
Thus, there is a nitrogen-cycle in nature in which nitrogen passes from its elemental form in the atmosphere into simple molecules in the soil and water, which get converted to more complex molecules in living beings and back again to the simple nitrogen molecule in the atmosphere.

32 Why Ozone does not contribute to warming of atmosphere near to Earth's surface?
a)  It is not stable near Earth's surface.
b)  It can contribute to warming only where weather phenomenon is absent.
c)  Sun's rays near earth's surface do not contain ultraviolet rays
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
 Learning The oxygen we find in our atmosphere is made up of two oxygen atoms (O2). Because of its chemical formulation, a single atom of oxygen (O) is unstable. That is, it wants to combine with something else. That is why oxygen is almost always found in pairs, in its (diatomic) form, where it is more stable. O3 is less stable than O2, because it wants to return to the diatomic state by giving up an oxygen atom.
When enough ozone molecules are present, it forms a pale blue gas. It is an unstable molecule that readily combines with other atoms. So, (a) is correct.
Ozone has the same chemical structure whether it is found in the stratosphere or the troposphere, and so has the same warming potential. Option (b) is thus wrong.
Ultraviolet rays do not cause warming, infrared does. So, (c) is also wrong.

33 What is Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) signed recently between Indian authorities and several MNCs?
a)  An agreement to regulate futures trading by the MNCs
b)  An agreement to restrict the involvement of MNCs in security markets and speculation
c)  An agreement for appropriating transfer pricing methodology.
d)  An agreement to restrict upwards revision of price of sensitive commodities in India
Answer: C
 The concept of APA is related with that of transfer pricing. It has been covered in the last 
In the past, several Multi-National Companies (MNCs) operating in India were often accused of misusing the transfer pricing system. MNCs like Vodafone, Shell, WNS and Nokia were mainly involved in this issue by misusing the system for
transferring profits to their subsidiaries in countries having low tax rates.
By signing APAs, Government is seeking to foster an environment of co-operation in matters of taxation through predictability of laws and reducing litigation cases in future. It is considered as a major push towards providing certainty to foreign investors in the arena of transfer pricing.

34 You are verbally communicating with your friend who is separated from you by a large space which can be filled with any one of the following at a time.
1.  Distilled Water
2.  Hydrogen
3.  Sea water
Your friend is likely to hear you earliest and la
a)  1 and 2
b)  2 and 3
c)  3 and 2
d)  1 and 3
Answer: C
Justification Speed of sound depends on the density of the medium. Here the speed of sound is highest in sea water, followed by distilled water and hydrogen.
So, your friend will hear you earliest through Sea water medium and la
Hydrogen filled medium. So, (c) is correct.
 The speed of sound in a medium depends also on temperature and pressure of the medium. The speed of sound decreases when we go from solid to gaseous state. In any medium as we increase the temperature the speed of sound increases.
For example, the speed of sound in air is 331 m/s at 0 degrees Celsius and 344 m/s at 22 degrees Celsius.

35 Apart from vehicles, Bharat stage (BS) norms are emission standards for

3.  Natural gas exploration companies
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Bharat stage (BS) norms are emission standards decided by the government to regulate the amount of air pollutants from vehicles.
They are not imposed on any industry as such. So, all statements are wrong.
 They were adopted in line with European regulation standard 'Euro norms' in 2000. So far, 4 states of Bharat stage (BS) norms have been issued by
government. In each stage certain limit is specified on the released pollutants and in the succeeding higher stages, the BS norms reduces the limit of pollutant emission
Union Government has recently decided to advance the date for implementation of Bharat Stage (BS) V and BS VI emission norms for four-wheelers in order to reduce vehicular air pollution from road transport sector.

a)  A critic of the free market economic system
b)  Dynamic role of agriculture in industrial c)  The theory of mercantilism which advocates increasing wealth by more exports
d)  Development of a centrally planned economic system
Answer: A
Justification Option (c) was popular even prior to Adam Smith gave his laissez fairez theory.
The role of agriculture in industrial development had been recognized only recently. So, (b) is wrong.
Centrally planned economic system was the socialistic prescription of the Soviet Era. Keynes did not advocate central planning; he instead advocated appropriate fiscal and monetary policies by government which could stabilize an economy in case of a shock.
He argued that free market system does not always lead to full employment, economic stability and welfare of citizens. So, (d) is incorrect and (a) is correct.

b)  1, 2 and 3 only
c)  1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Infrasound can result from both natural and human sources:
It sometimes results naturally from severe weather, surf, lee waves, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes, bolides, waterfalls, calving of icebergs, aurorae, meteors, lightning and upper-atmospheric lightning.
Infrasound can be generated by human processes such as sonic booms and explosions (both chemical and nuclear), or by machinery such as diesel engines, wind turbines and specially designed mechanical transducers (industrial vibration
tables). Certain specialized loudspeaker designs are also able to reproduce extremely low frequencies
Scientists have picked up infrasounds from two tsunamis during 2006 in the pacific ocean. To study the phenomena systematically the researchers have recently set up a tsunami infrasound project in Hawaii. The scientists hope to learn how the giant waves produce infrasound, which is currently a mystery.
Rhinoceroses communicate using infrasound of frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales
and elephants produce sound in the infrasound range. It is observed that some animals get disturbed before earthquakes.

58 When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. But, the pace at which the gun recoils is much lesser than that of bullet. What can be the reason for this?
a)  The bullet is being shot from the barrel of the Gun, which is its source.
b)  The Gun extends even behind the bullet in position, so it recoils lesser.
c)  Bullet is made from frictionless material and then shot, whereas the Gun is held in hand
d)  Gun has larger mass than the bullet
Answer: D
 The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
It is important to note that even though the action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes.
This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass. When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an
equal and opposite reaction force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun.
Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet.
Hence, (d) is correct.

59 Apart from China and India, trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the civilizations of
1.  Europe
2.  Horn of Africa
3.  Scandinavia
4.  West Africa
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1, 3 and 4 only
c)  2 and 4 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
Below is the map of the Silk Road. We are emphasizing on Silk road as it is important for Prelims, due to China's One road One belt initiative.
The road connected civilizations across Europe, Asia (including Persia, Arabia) and
Africa (only the horn part).
The disappearance of the Silk Road following the end of the Mongols' reign was one of the main factors that stimulated the Europeans to reach the prosperous Chinese empire through another route, especially by sea.
The direct ocean route from Europe to the East was finally opened by the expeditions of Bartolomeu Dias (1488), and Vasco da Gama (1497-1499), by the Atlantic and the Indian oceans.

60 Which of the following could NOT have contributed to Great Depression of 1930s?
1.  Agricultural over-production
2.  Credit contraction by USA
3.  Fragile post-World War I economy
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  All factors could have contributed.
Answer: D
 Statement 1: During the war time, most of the wheat exports went to war zones. Moreover, production in Eastern Europe had declined. After the war, when production in Eastern Europe resumed, it led to over-supply and falling prices. Thus income of farmers declined and this led to an overall decline in the demand, investment and production.
Statement 2: In the 1920s, most countries financed their investments by borrowing from the US. US overseas lenders panicked at the economic slowdown, and withdrew most loans from the market. This withdrawal of credit affected Europe as its banks collapsed and major currencies depreciated greatly. Moreover, US hiked import duties to save its economy. All this dealt a severe blow to the global economy.
Statement 3: Fragile post-war economy: war goods during the FWW had created most of the production boom. With the war ending, this production declined, leading to job losses, decline in income and further decline in demand of goods. It created a vicious cycle of low demand, low investment and unemployment.

 Ports in India are classified as Major and Minor Ports according to the jurisdiction of the Central and State government as defined under
the Indian Ports Act, 1908. So, (a) is correct.
Major Ports are under the Union list of the Indian Constitution and are administered under the Indian Ports Act 1908 and the Major Port Trust Act,
1963. Each major port is governed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the
Government of India.
The tariffs for major ports are fixed by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports
(TAMP).
Minor operates are managed at the State level by the department in charge of ports or the State Maritime Board, if created, as is the case in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
The functions of the State maritime boards are similar to those of port trusts, and also include the authority to set tariffs. They also focus on attracting private investment by awarding concession contracts, providing incentives, exclusivity rights and assuring land acquisition.

62 How was the Jute industry affected after partition in India?
1.  All the jute mills went to Eastern Pakistan.
2.  Majority of jute growing areas in India went to Eastern Pakistan.
3.  No marketing system for Jute existed in India thereafter and had to be created afresh.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  2 only
Answer: D
 Due to Partition an articial barrier between jute supply- demand in India as 81% of existing jute cultivation was in what became East Pakistan, while all of the mills were in West Bengal.
Moreover, East Pakistan imposed export duties on raw jute, and selectively reduced the quality of jute shipped to India. Most of the Jute Industrialist started to evacuate India, leaving behind the industrial setup of the Jute Industry. The twin results were
a sharp decline in the supply of raw jute to Indian mills, and a subsequent increase in
the price of raw jute until 1950 (remaining near WWII price levels).
Hence, there was a reduction of the quality of the finished product in India. India's textile export decreased as the result of these developments.

63 Multinational corporations (MNCs) are those entities which
a)  invest in security markets of a nation abroad
b)  invest in sovereign bonds of at least two or more nations
c)  are allowed to raise funding from abroad
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
Even a retail investor (a common man) can invest in security markets abroad. Also, several stock brokerage firms (operating within only one nation) can invest all over the World. They are not called MNCs. So, (a) is wrong.
Similar to the reasoning mentioned above, (b) is wrong.
It is possible for even a domestic firm to raise capital from abroad. It becomes an
MNC only when it operates in more than one nation. So, (c) is wrong.
The first MNCs were established in the 1920s. Many more came up in the
1950s and 1960s as US businesses expanded worldwide and Western Europe and
Japan also recovered to become powerful industrial economies.
The worldwide spread of MNCs was a notable feature of the 1950s and 1960s. This was partly because high import tariffs imposed by different governments forced MNCs to locate their manufacturing operations and become'domestic producers' in as many countries as possible.

64 Which of the following provisions ensure that the federal structure of a polity is maintained?
1.  Constitution cannot be amended completely/fundamentally by any one level of
2.  government.
3.  There is an independent judiciary which resolves disputes between the federal organs.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Statement 1: The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government. For e.g. Central govt. In India cannot usurp all powers of the states in the state list of the 7th schedule.
Statement 2: Suppose, if any one government resolved the disputes between federal constituents, there will be a violation of natural justice. So, an independent judiciary is needed.

65 'Gomasthas' in pre-independent India referred to
a)  An Indian agent of the British East India Company employed to sign agreements with local labour
b)  The local zamindars responsible for collection of revenue for the British treasury
c)  Earliest Indian entrepreneurs that lobbied for'Discriminating Protection' by the British
d)  A union of merchants that financed the earliest Indian cotton industries
Answer: A
In the 18th century, the East India Company had established itself in India. Indian cotton and silk fabrics were in great demand worldwide and hence were of special interest to them.
It proceeded to develop a system of management and control that would eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies of cotton and silk goods. Given the small number of Englishmen, and their unfamiliarity with the local language and society, the Company turned to local intermediaries, and gave them legal authority to enforce contracts.
The Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more direct control over
the weaver. For this purpose they appointed paid servants called the gomasthas were employed who would obtain goods and from local weavers and fix their prices.
The prices fixed were 15 per cent lower than market price and in extreme cases, even 40 per cent lower than the market price.
They would also supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine the quality of cloth. They also prevented Company weavers from dealing with other buyers.

66 The Temperance movement of 19th century Britain and America was a middleclass-led social reform movement against the social evil of alcoholism. It draws a parallel in India with the popular
a)  Sarvodaya campaign against alcohol of 1960s
b)  Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha (CMM) rally of 1980s
c)  Unmoolan Andolan in West Bengal 1970s
d)  Peoples Action for Rural Awakening (PARa) 1980s
Answer: A
Taking care of innocent children is one of the prime concerns of
PARA. So, (d) is wrong.
CMM rally was about miner's rights and welfare. So, (b) is also wrong. There is no movement named unmoolan andolan in WB. So, (c) is wrong.
 In independent India, sarvodaya activists campaigned for prohibition. A mass campaign against liquor sale emerged in Uttarakhand, then part of UP, in the early 1960s. Vimla and Sunderlal Bahuguna got the government to cancel a contract to sell liquor in their village.
By 1966, pro
the Chipko movement and, then, the struggle for a separate Uttarakhand state.
Another notable mass movement against liquor was in Andhra Pradesh in the early
1990s.

67 Plebiscite refers to the process where
a)  Citizens of a country can propose legislation for adoption by the legislature
b)  Local citizen bodies monitor important government decisions
c)  Citizens vote to accept or reject a proposal
d)  Citizens can amend the constitution of a nation by a special procedure
Answer: C
Option (a) is the like the practice of "initiative" present in some democratic nations like Canada.
Option (b) is akin to PRIs and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
 A referendum (in some countries synonymous with plebiscite — or a vote on a ballot question) is a direct vote in which an entire electorate is asked to vote on a particular proposal. This may result in the adoption of a new law.
For e.g. recently in Greece, the government asked the voter to choose an austerity package for Greece or choose to exit from European Union.

68 Mahalanobis model of post-independent India stressed upon
a)  Promoting economic growth through the production of wage-goods
b)  Promoting an export-led growth for the Indian economy
c)  Promoting capital (heavy) intensive economic growth
d)  Promoting tertiary and agricultural sector over the Industrial sector
Answer: C
Mahalanobis strategy of development emphasising basic heavy industries which was adopted first of all in the Second Plan also continued to hold the stage in Indian planning right up to the Fifth Plan which was terminated by the Janata Government in March 1978, a year before its full term of five years.
In critique of the Mahalanobis heavy industry development strategy, Professors Vakil and Brahmanand of Bombay University put forward a wage-goods model of development and suggested a development strategy which accorded a top priority to agriculture and other wage-goods industries in sharp contrast to the Mahalanobis heavy industry biased strategy of development.
So, the essential pillars of Nehru - Mahalanobis strategy were - (a) high savings rate, (b) heavy industry bias, (c) protectionist policies and public sector, (d) import substitution, and (e) socialistic pattern of society.

69 Akhlaq-i Nasiri is a
a)  Part of the overall code of conduct of Akbar's Sulh-i-Kul religion
b)  Persian book in philosophical ethics written by Al-Tusi
c)  A sufi practice of extreme asceticism followed by penance
d)  A group of scholars in Akbar's Ibadat Khana who wrote religious codes
Answer: B
Akbar ruled with a social and religious toleration that was relative, not absolute, and was based on his concept of sulh-i-kul (for the general good of all people) which built on his liberal views of religion. This was however not connected with the book in question. So, (a) is wrong.
Ibadat khana was a place where Akbar used to have religious discussions. (c) is also wrong.
The book Akhlaq-i Nasiri is divided to three parts: ethics, domestic economy and politics.
It is considered a medieval treatise on Ismaili Thought.

70 Which of the following are NOT the general features of'capitalistic' economies?
1.  Competitive markets
2.  Centrally planned economy
3.  Public ownership of labour and capital
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 3 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 only
d)  2 and 3 only
Answer: D
 Statement 2 and 3 are generally features of socialistic pattern of economy. Hence, wrong.
Capitalistic economies may have monopolistic as well competitive markets. However, the core idea is that it should be a free market which operates without any government interference.
Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods and services for profit
Central characteristics of capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labour and competitive markets.
In a capitalist market economy, investments are determined by private decision and the parties to a transaction typically determine the prices at which they exchange assets, goods, and service

71 Until Independence,'Feudalism' was NOT in practice in India in which of the following regions/states?
1.  Kerala
2.  Maharashtra
3.  TamilNadu
4.  Jharkhand
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  1 only
c)  1, 3 and 4 only
d)  None of (a), (b) or (c) is correct.
Answer: D
 It was in practice in all these states.
The Jharkhand region (now a state) of India was a hotbed for feudalism. Feudal
lords ruled the region for decades; semi-feudal conditions still exist. So, 4 is correct.
There were a number of feudal states in Kerala in the Middle Ages between the end of Chera dynasty and the British rule. So, 1 is correct.
Several zamindaris were established in the Madras Presidency (present-day Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas) from 1799 onwards. The zamindari settlement was based on an a similar settlement established in Bengal. So, 3 is correct.
In Maharashtra, Vidharbha region has feudal lords.
Use of the term feudalism to describe India applies a concept of medieval European origin, according to which the landed nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles,
while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection.

72 The Vernacular Press Act in British India was concerned with
a)  Promoting local language newspapers for generating local employment
b)  Providing for licensing and registration of newspapers published by indigenous tribes
c)  Banning all vernacular language publications in India
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
The Vernacular Press Act was passed in 1878 under the Governor Generalship and Viceroyalty of Lord Lytton, for better control of Indian language newspapers.
The purpose of the Act was to control the printing and circulation of seditious material, specifically that which could produce disaffection against the British Government in India in the minds of the masses. It was passed on the model of irish press laws.
It provided the government extensive rights to censor report and editorial in vernacular press.
At the time the Vernacular Press Act was passed, there were thirty five vernacular papers in Bengal, including the Amrita Bazar Patrika

73 In pre-independent India, journal with the name "Vande Mataram" was started/
published by
1.  Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay
2.  Lala Lajpat Rai
3.  Bipin Chandra Pal
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: A
Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote the song "Vande matram"
inspired by which Bipin Chandra Pal decided to start a patriotic journal in August
1906, name vande matram. So, 1 is incorrect and 3 is correct.
Lala Lajpath Rai started an Urdu daily- "Vande Mataram" from Lahore which boasted huge circulation.
Its first edition itself was confiscated by police and he had to appeal to the high court against this. Four editors of this newspaper were sent to jail under the charge of sedition.

74 The recent cabinet approval of signing of Double Taxation Avoidance Convention
(DTAC) between India and Japan will help in
1.  Improving the investment climate in India
2.  Amending banking laws to give banks legal power for cracking down on money
3.  laundering
4.  Getting mutual assistance in matters related to collection of revenue
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: C
  It includes exchange of banking information between tax authorities, but it does not involved amending laws as such, or giving greater legal powers to banks. So, 2 is incorrect.
It aims at avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The protocol incorporates provisions for an effective exchange of information and assistance in collection of taxes between tax authorities of the two countries.

75 Apart from determination of foetus, which of the following can be the applications of
Ultrasound?
1.  To detect cracks and flaws in metal blocks
2.  In sonic weapons
3.  To deliver drugs directly to the cells
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
The cracks or holes inside the metal blocks, which are invisible from outside reduces the strength of the structure. Ultrasonic waves are allowed to pass through the metal block and detectors are used to detect the transmitted waves. If there is even a small defect, the ultrasound gets reflected back indicating the presence of the flaw or defect. So, 1 is correct.
Sonic and ultrasonic weapons (USW) are weapons of various types that use sound to injure, incapacitate, or kill an opponent. Some sonic weapons are currently in
limited use or in research and development by military and police forces. So, 2 is correct.
High power ultrasound can break up stony deposits or tissue, accelerate the effect of drugs in a targeted area, but not deliver drugs. Delivering drugs can be possible through nanotechnology. So, 3 is incorrect.

76 The Sagarmala project of the Government of India focuses on
1.  Construction of defence checkposts in Indian Ocean littoral nations
2.  Deepening Straits of Malacca to increase frequency of shipping to India
3.  Port-led development of coastal areas
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: B
It is not an attempt to counter China's string of pearls. So, 1 is wrong. It does not extend to international waters. So, 2 is wrong.
The Sagarmala initiative will address these challenges by focusing on three pillars of development, namely (i) Supporting and enabling Port-led
Development through appropriate policy and institutional interventions and
providing for an institutional framework for ensuring inter-agency and ministries/departments/states' collaboration for integrated development, (ii) Port Infrastructure Enhancement, including modernization and setting up of new ports, and (iii) Efficient Evacuation to and from hinterland.
It is essentially an infrastructure-cum-policy initiative. It will allow the central government to have a say in the development of non-major ports without adopting a confrontationist approach with the state governments. Necessary institutional framework will be built for the same.

77 The Green Highways Policy will NOT help in
a)  Increasing the forest cover of India
b)  Reducing road accidents
c)  Cutting down pollution
d)  Reducing the land acquisition required for road construction
Answer: D
1% of total highways outlays will be reserved for planting trees along the highways. It will be counted in the official forest cover. So, (a) is not correct.
Trees along the highways reduce glare coming from vehicle lights and sun light, which have been a cause for road accidents. So, (b) is not correct.
(c) is obvious as trees will act as carbon sink.
It may actually increase the land acquisition as well as it cost. Land acquisition related issues are not the focal point of policy. So, (d) is the answer.
About Rs. 1000 crore per year will be available for plantation purpose. The policy will generate employment opportunities for about five lakh people from rural areas.
There will be strong monitoring mechanism in place by using ISRO's Bhuvan and GAGAN satellite systems. Every planted tree will be counted and auditing will be done. The agencies performing well will be awarded.

78 If you use a spring balance to weigh an object kept in different mediums, it will weigh least in
a)  Ethanol
b)  Sea water
c)  Lubricating Oil
d)  Freshwater lake
Answer: B
All objects experience a force of buoyancy upwards when they are immersed in a fluid. This buoyant force reduces the total pressure/force the object exerts on a spring balance.
The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid. So, the denser the liquid, higher is the buoyant force, and lesser is the weight experienced.
Sea water has a density of 1022 kg/cubic metres, fresh water has 1000, ethanol has
786, and lubricating oil has around 900. So, it weighs least in sea water. Hence, (b) is correct.

79 What is/are the difference(s) between a fixed exchange rate and floating exchange rate?
1.  Fixed exchange rate is fixed by the IMF whereas floating rate is left to the markets.
2.  Trade of a nation is done based on floating exchange rate whereas foreign investment is done based on fixed exchange rates.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
IMF does not peg a currency's level. It was done earlier in the Gold system where currencies were fixed in value by some authority, for e.g. USA
government fixed it by an agreement for India and other nations. So, 1 is wrong.
If a nation follows floating system, all its external transactions are based on the floating system; similar for the fixed system. So, 2 is wrong.
Exchange rates— They link national currencies for purposes of international trade. There are broadly two kinds of exchange rates: fixed exchange rate and floating exchange rate
Fixed exchange rates — When exchange rates are fixed and governments intervene to prevent movements in them
Flexible or floating exchange rates — These rates fluctuate depending on demand and supply of currencies in foreign exchange markets, in principle without interference by governments.

80 Consider the following about the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
1.  It is a specialised agency of the United Nations.
2.  It is responsible for regulating shipping in international waters.
3.  Most states that are not members of IMO are landlocked countries.
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1, 2 and 3
b)  2 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1 only
Answer: A
IMO is governed by an assembly of members and is financially administered by a council of members elected from the assembly.
The IMO's primary purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory framework for shipping and its remit today includes safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation, maritime security and the efficiency of shipping. So, 2 is correct.
These landlocked countries include Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia, Belarus, Bhutan, Botswana etc. So, 3 is correct.
India has been one of the earliest members of the IMO, having ratified its
Convention and joined it as a member-state in the year 1959. India has had the privilege of being elected to and serving the Council of the IMO, ever since it started functioning, and till date, except for two years for the period 1983-1984.
IMO Council plays a crucial role to play in deciding various important matters within the mandate of the IMO, in relation to the global shipping industry, including its work programme strategy and budget.

81 Diamond quadrilateral project of Indian railways intends to
a)  connect all seven North-eastern states with Eastern nations
b)  connect four most important mining regions in the country by way of a freight network
c)  connect four metro cities by high speed rail networks
d)  develop rail-road linkages in four farthest corners of the country
Answer: C
 The Diamond Quadrilateral is a project of the Indian railways to establish high speed rail network in India. This quadrilateral will connect the four metro cities in India, i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.
This project is similar to Golden Quadrilateral which is a roadway project which connects the four metros by Express Ways. The Golden Quadrilateral falls under National Highways Development Project which has helped to build better road transport in India.
India has planned to start Semi-high speed trains on nine corridors and has ambition to run bullet trains in future. High-speed train on Mumbai-Ahmedabad section will be the first bullet train corridor to be implemented in the country.

82 The acoustics of a theatre can be changed by
1.  Changing its architecture
2.  Changing its building material
3.  Reducing or increasing the audience sitting in the place
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
You can make the building taller, shorter, wider, flatter, narrower, circular etc. All of this will have an effect on how sound is transmitted and felt inside the place. So, 1 is correct.
After production, sound is transmitted and reflected throughout the building. Changing the building material will change the total absorption /reflection of sound. For e.g. putting more cushion and less metal in the seats will reduce reflection of sound. So, 2 is also correct.
Audience (people) act as absorbers of sound. If you walk into an empty hall, an echo can be heard, but rarely in a filled hall. So, 3 is also correct.
 A sound created in a big hall will persist by repeated reflection from the walls until it is reduced to a value where it is no longer audible. The repeated reflection that results in this persistence of sound is called reverberation. In an auditorium or big hall excessive reverberation is highly undesirable.
To reduce reverberation, the roof and walls of the auditorium are generally covered with sound-absorbent materials like compressed fibreboard, rough plaster or draperies. The seat materials are also selected on the basis of their sound absorbing properties.

83 The Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile (LRSAM) co-developed by India and Israel was recently 
1.  It can counter air attacks from drones and anti-ship missiles.
2.  It is an active radar seeking missile.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
LRSAM is also called Barak 8 missile in Israel which in Hebrew language means Lightning. Barak 8 is an advanced, long-range missile defence and air defence system.
Its main features are long range, active radar seeker missile, vertical launch and multiple simultaneous engagements.
For the LRSAM, DRDO has developed dual pulse propulsion system along with other safety arm mechanisms for Solid Propulsion system.
The LRSAM programme consists of Missiles, Weapon Control System, MFSTAR (Radar), Vertical Launcher unit and two- way data link.
It is capable to counter a wide variety of air-borne threats such as anti-ship missiles, aircraft, UAVs and drones as well as supersonic cruise missiles.

84 Sonic boom is a phenomenon related with
a)  Ultrasonic sounds produced by small vertebrates
b)  Supersonic sounds produced by moving objects
c)  Destruction of sea bed due to SONAR waves
d)  Repeated reflection of sound in a closed space that increases its effect
manifold
Answer: B
Option (d) is related with Echo.
Option (a) is related with communication in species like bats.
The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). But, SONAR waves do not cause destruction of sea bed. So, (c) is wrong.
When the speed of any object exceeds the speed of sound it is said to be travelling at supersonic speed. Bullets, jet aircrafts etc. often travel at supersonic speeds. When a sound, producing source moves with a speed higher than that of sound, it produces shock waves in air.
These shock waves carry a large amount of energy. The air pressure variation associated with this type of shock waves produces a very sharp and loud sound called the "sonic boom". The shock waves produced by a supersonic aircraft have enough energy to shatter glass and even damage buildings.

85 A large gold nail usually sinks in water. What can be done to prevent it from sinking?
a)  Increasing its height or length to cover greater area of water for the given weight
b)  Decreasing its width to experience a sideward uplifting pressure from water
c)  Increasing its total volume for the given weight
d)  Reducing its surface area for the given weight
Answer: C
When a body is immersed fully or partially in a fluid, it experiences an upward force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it.
The weight of the fluid displaced depends on the volume of the object and its density.
Basically, density of water * volume of water displaced should be = density of the object * its volume immersed in water.
If you increase the volume it can displace more water, which will exert greater upwards force on its preventing it from sinking.
This concept is used in the design of ships and submarines. So, (c) is correct, and others are wrong, because neither increased surface area nor length helps it.

86 Oxygen is returned to the atmosphere in which of the following processes?
1.  Photosynthesis
2.  Formation of Ozone
3.  Nitrogen-fixation by legume bacteria
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: C
Here is the oxygen cycle.
If you notice, the only major process returning oxygen is photosynthesis. This is why afforestation is of even greater importance to tackle climate change and pollution.
Formation of ozone consumes oxygen. Even the process of nitrogen-fixing by bacteria does not take place in the presence of oxygen. So, 2 and 3 are incorrect.

87 The Delhi Right of Citizen to Time Bound Delivery of Services Amendment Bill, 2015 as passed by the Delhi assembly
1.  Ensures mandatory and automatic compensation for citizens if government services are not provided to them in time
2.  Imposes penalty on officials for delay in providing services.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
Apart from the ones mentioned in the option, key provisions of the Bill are:
It seeks to make the life of common man hassle free by providing services in a time bound manner.
It also makes it mandatory for each government department, local body and public authority will issue a'Citizen's Charter'.
They would set out in detail the time stipulated for provision of citizen- related services and the officer responsible for providing it. Otherwise, it Imposes penalty on officials for delay in providing services.

88 Mixed cropping is the practice of
a)  Growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land
b)  Growing crops and rearing livestock simultaneously
c)  Growing different crops on a piece of land in a pre-planned succession
d)  Growing fodder crops alongwith livestock
Answer: A
Option (b) is mixed FARMING. Note the difference. Option (c) is crop rotation, where crops are not grown simultaneously.
Option (d) is also a kind of mixed farming practice, where food is also grown side by side.
Different ways of growing crops can be used to give maximum benefit. Mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of
land, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat + mustard, or groundnut + sunflower.
This reduces risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops.
Depending upon the duration, crop rotation is done for different crop combinations. The availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests.
Other such practice is inter-cropping which has been covered in an earlier 

89 Consider the following about the Lalit Kala Akademi or National Academy of Art

1.  They have a significant proportion of Indian diaspora.
2.  Littoral nations are being used for building naval and military bases by other nations.
3.  Majority of India's shipping trade passes through these littoral nations.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: A
For e.g. India has a major interest in Seychelles. A fair sized (8%) population of Indian descent, mainly from Tamil Nadu and Gujarat lives there. So, 1 is correct.
Seychelles could be considered as an `unsinkable aircraft carrier` in the Indian Ocean given its proximity to the oil sea lanes and oil producing nations, quite akin to the Ascension island in the Atlantic that the British used extensively to launch attacks against the Argentinean Navy in the Falklands war. In fact, China is using it for its string of pearls. So, 2 is correct.
Majority of oil tankers pass through these regions, not majority of trade. So, 3 will be incorrect.

The mineral nutrients are divided into two groups: macronutrients and micronutrients.
Macronutrients can be broken into two more groups: primary and secondary nutrients.
The primary nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These major nutrients usually are lacking from the soil first because plants use large amounts for their growth and survival.
The secondary nutrients are calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S). There are usually enough of these nutrients in the soil so fertilization is not always needed. Also, large amounts of Calcium and Magnesium are added when lime is applied to acidic soils.
So, (d) is the answer as all others are micro-nutrients.
The 13 mineral nutrients, which come from the soil, are dissolved in water and absorbed through a plant's roots. There are not always enough of these nutrients in the soil for a plant to grow healthy. This is why many farmers and gardeners use fertilizers to add the nutrients to the soil.

92 Consider the following about'Nuclear fusion'.
1.  It is triggered by fundamental particle neutrinos.
2.  Few nuclear reactors operational in India use this technology.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Nuclear fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come very close and then collide at a very high speed and join to form a new nucleus.
During this process, matter is not conserved because some of the matter of the
fusing nuclei is converted to photons (energy). So, neutrinos do not have any role to play as they hardly interact with matter. So, 1 is incorrect.
All reactors in India use nuclear fission technology. Fusion technology has not been developed for commercial uses at large scales. So, 2 is incorrect.

93 Why does the sky appear dark instead of blue to an astronaut?
a)  Due to Light pillar effect
b)  Due to absence of diffracted interference of light
c)  Due to absence of dispersion and diffusion
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light.
Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights. So, the answer is (d).
A light pillar is an atmospheric optical phenomenon in the form of a
vertical column of light which appears to extend above and/or below a light source.
Diffraction refers to various phenomena which occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit. In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves.

94 How industrial effluents dumped in water body may be a threat to aquatic life?
1.  By increasing the nutrient content of the water
2.  Leading to depletion of oxygen levels of the water body
3.  Disrupting the aquatic food chain by killing keystone species
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  All of the above
Answer: D
 Eutrophication is the process by which a body of water acquires a high concentration of nutrients, especially phosphates and nitrates. These typically promote excessive growth of algae. As the algae die and decompose, high levels of organic matter and the decomposing organisms deplete the water of available oxygen, causing the death of other organisms, such as fish. Eutrophication is a natural, slow-aging process for a water body, but human activity (industrial effluents for e.g. ) greatly speeds up the process. So, 1 is correct.
Heated Industrial effluents increase the temperature of the water body and typically decrease the level of dissolved oxygen of water. This can harm aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. So, 2 is correct.
A keystone species is a plant or animal that plays a unique and crucial role in the way an ecosystem functions (e.g. sea star). Statement 3 follows.

95 The Central government can legally undertake the development of an inland waterway for navigation only when
a)  It falls under the major-basins of the country
b)  It is connected to a major port of national importance
c)  It has been declared as a national waterway
d)  It does not border any tribal areas falling under the fifth and sixth schedule
Answer: C
 The Union Cabinet recently gave its approval for enactment of Central legislation for declaring 101 additional Inland Waterways as National Waterways (NW) for navigation. If a waterway is not declared national waterways, it cannot be used for development for navigational purposes.
This will create a logistic supply chain with intermodal (Rail, Road and Waterways) connectivity and "would positively contribute to the GDP by opening up business opportunities in the area of dredging, barge construction, barge operation, barge repair facilities, terminal construction, tourist cruise etc.
On declaration of a waterway as a NW, development and regulation for shipping and navigation by mechanically propelled vessels come under the jurisdiction of Central Government.
However, rights over the usage of water, ownership of appurtenant land, minerals, metals, sand etc continue to be with the State Government.

96 You can see a full-length image of a tall building/tree in a
a)  Concave Mirror
b)  Convex Mirror
c)  Plane Mirror
d)  Hydraulic Mirrors
Answer: B
 For rays coming from a distance, convex mirrors always give an erect, though diminished, image. They also have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. So, if you wish to obtain a large image in a small mirror, you should use convex mirrors. So, (b) is correct.
If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full-length image of a distant,
tall building/tomb in the wall mirror. To view the tomb distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace adjoining the wall.
Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the driver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger area than would be possible with a plane mirror.

97 'Opium wars' of the mid-19th century are related to
a)  Anglo-Chinese disputes over British trade in China and China's sovereignty
b)  Conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and European powers joined into a Holy League
c)  A major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican politics and society
d)  Rights of Christian minorities in Mediterranean, which was controlled by the
Ottoman Empire
Answer: A
 Opium wars are an important even in the fight against imperialism, hence, the question.
Option (b) refers to the Great Turkish war beginning in 1683 and ending with the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. The war was a defeat for the Ottoman Empire, which lost large amounts of territory in Central
Europe. The war was also significant in that it marked the first time Russia was involved in a western European alliance.
Option (c) refers to Mexican Revolution 1910-20.
Option (d) refers to the Crimean War (which was also in news due to the Ukraine
Crisis 2013-14).
The disputes included the First Opium War (1839 —1842) and the
Second Opium War (1856—1860).
They are important because the wars and events between them weakened the Qing
dynasty and reduced China's separation from the rest of the world.

98 Your weight on earth can increase if
1.  Earth revolves faster around the Sun.
2.  You travel very fast on earth
3.  You cross the troposphere and reach stratosphere
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
Your weight on earth depends on two things: a) gravitation force of earth; and b) the centrifugal force caused due to earth's rotation, which pushes you away from earth's surface. The balance of both forces determines your weight.
Your weight will change only if the speed of rotation (and not revolution) changes. So, 1 is incorrect.
Also, as described above, it really does not matter how fast you are travelling on earth, because as long as you are on earth's surface, you will experience the same gravitational force. So, 2 is also incorrect.
Your weight will decrease if you move to greater height in stratosphere. So, 3 is wrong.

99 International Monetary Fund (IMF) has included China's Yuan into its elite reserve currency basket. What implications can it have on the International reserve asset system?
1.  Nations will now prefer holding more Yuan in their forex Reserves.
2.  Yuan will now be used for calculation of the value of a SDR.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 A reserve currency is one which is being used widely in international transactions, has a stable value and is freely usable and convertible. China's Yuan satisfied all these criteria and thus IMF declared it to be an elite reserve currency.
With this declaration, nations will prefer holding Chinese Yuan as it gives more liquidity to their forex reserves. This is because the currency is now worldwide acceptable for settlement of trade payments. Hence, 1 is correct.
SDR is neither a currency nor a claim on the IMF. It is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members, which holders of SDRs can
obtain in exchange for their SDRs. Its value is based on the basket of the four major currencies, which now becomes five including Yuan. So, 2 is correct.

100 In a spacecraft, it is possible to create "artificial gravity" by
a)  Surrounding the spacecraft by heavy water (deuterium)
b)  Shooting the spacecraft from the ground at a very high speed
c)  Use material in the spacecraft that can shield against the lack of gravity in space
d)  Spinning the spacecraft on its axis
Answer: D
Gravity is omnipresent, and it can never be shielded against. So, (c) is incorrect.
Irrespective of the material used, gravity would not change inside the spacecraft. So, (a) is also incorrect.
Shooting at high speed will not affect the gravity forces. It will only help escape arth's gravity quickly. So, (b) is also incorrect.
In space, it is possible to create "artificial gravity" by spinning your spacecraft or space station. When the station spins, centrifugal force acts to pull the inhabitants to the outside. This process could be used to simulate gravity. It wouldn't be exactly the same, though, because large Coriolis forces would also be present,
and things would fall in curves instead of straight lines.
This is sort of like the amusement park ride where you get in a big cylinder with a lot of people and line up against the walls. Then they spin the cylinder, producing a force that makes you feel pressed up against the
sides. Everyone becomes glued to the walls of the chamber, and then they drop the floor out. No one falls to the ground because they are being held to the edges by a force due to rotation.
