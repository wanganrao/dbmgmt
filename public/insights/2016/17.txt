1 The institutions of urban local government originated and developed in modern India during the period of British rule. But, in Independent India it received constitutional recognition quite late in 1993. Which of the following can be the possible historical reason(s) for it?
1.  The subject of Local self-government was never devolved and decentralized at the provincial level.
2.  The subject of Local self-government was never handed over to a Indian Minister who would be responsible to a legislative assembly.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: D
 Statement 1: Under the provincial autonomy scheme introduced by the Government of India Act of 1935, local self-government was declared a provincial subject. So, 1 is clearly wrong.
Statement 2: Under the dyarchical scheme introduced in Provinces by the Government of India Act of 1919, local self-government became a transferred subject under the charge of a responsible Indian minister. So, 2 is also wrong.
One of the reasons for its late constitutional recognition was the lack of political consensus in India, especially between the Centre and States.

2 Consider the following about the Comparative Rating Index of Sovereigns (CRIS) as introduced by the Finance Ministry.
1.  A particular nation's rating score is independent of the performance of other nation.

Answer: D
 Statement 1: Major credit rating agencies give out the sovereign credit rating of each nation as an absolute grade. A particular nation's rating score is independent of the performance of other nation. But in the Comparative Rating Index of Sovereigns (CRIS) introduced by India, performance of one nation is compared with all other nations.
When an investor searches across nations for a place to put her money, the relative rating of nations is important. If nation x's rating remaining the same, other nations' ratings improve over time, there may well be a case to invest less in nation x
Statement 2: The computation of CRIS is based on Moody's ratings and data on the GDPs (not adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)) of different nations as given by the IMF. It is a pure mathematical and statistical methods without interventions or interpretations.
It is like a percentile score that you obtain in GATE or CAT examinations.

3 Consider the following about Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme 2015.

User Name :      Kant
on maturity. The Bond is issued by Reserve Bank on behalf of Government of India.
Statement 3: There may be a risk of capital loss if the market price of gold declines. However, the investor does not lose in terms of the units of gold which he has paid for.
But, the SGB offers a superior alternative to holding gold in physical form. The
risks and costs of storage are eliminated. Investors are assured of the market value of gold at the time of maturity and periodical interest.
SGB is free from issues like making charges and purity in the case of gold in jewellery form. The bonds are held in the books of the RBI or in demat form eliminating risk of loss of scrip etc.
Statement 4: Persons resident in India as defined under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 are eligible to invest in SGB. Eligible investors include individuals, HUFs, trusts, universities, charitable institutions, etc.

4 In Eastern India, under a no-tax campaign (1930-1940), villages refused to pay Chowkidara tax as there was considerable resentment due to these guards who supplemented the small police force in the rural areas. The resentment was due to

2.  They acted as retainers for the local landlords.
3.  They usurped judicial powers of the local panchayats.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 only

d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
 The movement against this tax and calling for the resignation of Chowkidars, and of the influential members of chowkidari panchayats who appointed the Chowkidars, first started in Bihar in May itself, as salt agitation had
not much scope due to the land-locked nature of the province.

a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect.

a)  Nominated by the Speaker of the House
b)  Nominated by the Governor of the concerned State
c)  Elected by the house from amongst its members
d)  Always the Leader of the largest party from the opposition

Statement 3: A new class of proteins capable of blocking the HIV virus from penetrating T-cells has been discovered. The proteins have been found in a coral from Australia's northern coast. Coral reefs are also being used in treatment of cancer.

11 The Union Finance Minister has extended the safeguard duty on import of some steel products by two years. Why is such a safeguard duty imposed on goods?
a)  To ensure that imports in excessive quantities do not harm the domestic industry
b)  To reduce excessive exports of goods in short supply domestically
c)  To subsidize strategically important infant industries
d)  To reduce production of a good to desirable levels for the economy
Answer: A
 The duty will be on the products which are imported at or above the minimum import price (MIP), which helps to set a floor price mainly to discourage imports below this price.
The main intention of this move is to protect domestic industry from onslaught of cheap steel supplies (imports) from China amid a global glut.

12 Eka Movement surfaced in Hardoi, Bahraich and Sitapur during the end of 1921. The main reason behind the movement was
a)  High land rents
b)  Religious persecution
c)  Forced recruitment in British Indian army
User Name :      Kant
d)  Untouchability
Answer: A
 It was a peasant movement.
The main reason of movement was higher rent, which was generally higher than
50% of recorded rent in some areas. Oppression of thekedhars who were entrusted to collect rent and practice of share rent also contributed to this movement.
Small zamindars who were disenchanted with British Government due to heavy land revenue demand were also a part of this movement.
Soon the leadership of Movement changed from Congress to Madari Pasi, a low caste leader who was not inclined to accept non-violence. This led the movement losing contact with nationalist class.
By 1922, due to severe repression of British the Eka Movement came to an end.

19 Scientists fear that ballast water carried by ships may adversely affect the biodiversity across the Indian Coast. Why is this so?
a)  Ballast water is polluted due to oil spills in the sea.
b)  Ballast water carries with itself iron and manganese rich water than is damaging to the coastal population.
c)  Ballast water is a higher temperature than the surrounding water thus causing thermal pollution.
d)  Ballast water carries with itself exotic invasive species.
User Name :      Kant
Answer: D
 Ballast is a compartment in a ship that provides it stability as it holds water which moves in and out of it to balance the ship.
The compartment usually remains below the water level in order to counteract the weight above the water level.
Ballast is one of the biggest transporters of non-native (exotic/invasive)
marine species.
Over 10,000 non-native marine species are transported across the world in the ballast water.
The colossal loads of ballast water carried by ships mainly transports fish, viruses, algae, zooplankton, bacteria and benthonic invertebrates to harbours at a faster pace.
Expansion of ports and minor ports could pave for the introduction of alien species in Indian marine and coastal areas.

4.  The nation is grappling with high inflation and low growth.

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  2 and 3 only
b)  1 and 4 only
c)  1, 3 and 4 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Statements 1, 2 and 3: United States of America continuously runs a trade deficit, but it is not a developing country, neither is its currency weak, nor is the demand for its exports weak.
A negative trade balance simply implies that the demand of the resident for foreign goods outstrips what foreign residents demand from that nation.
Moreover, you should see other factors like capital flows in the nation, remittances etc and the overall BoP situation. If it is favourable (positive), statement 2 would be incorrect.
Statement 4: It again depends on the overall BoP situation. If the BoP as well as trade balance is negative, the nation may suffer from currency devaluation. However, still we cannot conclusively say anything about the growth and inflation in the country. It depends on the economy's structure and its export-import composition.
For e.g. if rupee devaluates, we pay a higher price of essential commodities like oil, which inflate domestic prices.

37 Capital adequacy ratio (CAR) in the context of banking implies
a)  Minimum amount of capital that a promoter should have before applying for a banking license
b)  Upper limit to holding capital in cash for a scheduled commercial bank
c)  Fraction of total capital to the total risk-weighted assets
d)  Minimum CRR plus SLR that the commercial banks are required to hold with them
Answer: C
Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), a measure of a bank's capital, is expressed as a percentage of a bank's risk weighted credit exposures
As credit creation (i.e. loan disbursals) of banks is highly risky business, the depositors' money depends on the banks' quality of lending.
More importantly, the whole payment system, public as well as private, depends on banks.
Bank capital helps to prevent bank failure, which arises in case the bank cannot satisfy its obligations to pay the depositors and other creditors.
It is also a part of the overall Basel norms.

The above refer to?
a)  Service Tax
b)  Customs Duty
c)  Excise Duty
d)  Value-added tax
User Name :      Kant
Answer: D
  Goods require value addition by different service providers/ producers (the agents, the wholesalers and the retailers) before they reach the consumers.
From production to the level of sale, there are many points where value is added in all goods. VAT method of tax collection is different from the non-VAT method in the sense that it is imposed and collected at different points of value addition chain, i.e., multi-point tax collection.
That is why there is no chance of imposing tax upon tax which takes place in the non-VAT method -single point tax collection.
This is why VAT does not have a 'cascading effect' on the prices of goods it does not increase inflation-and is therefore highly suitable for an economy like India.

 Option (a) could have been right, and in fact external grants are the best way to finance deficit, as there is no repayment, no interest etc.
But, they do affect the domestic money supply. So, (a) is a wrong statement. Internal borrowing reduces the space for private sector borrowing, and crowds out
investment. It entails both interest rates and repayment, hence less preferred.
Printing currency is generally the least preferred route as it increases the money supply manifold (by money multiplier mechanism), and can lead to inflation. Moreover, it is not sustainable.

Answer: C
This old trilemma asserts that a country cannot maintain, simultaneously, all three policy goals of ' (a) free capital flows, (b) a fixed exchange rate, and (c) an independent monetary policy.
Option 1: If we maintain free capital flows and a fixed exchange rate, the money supply in the economy will increase/decrease with an increase/decrease in capital flows. There is no way we can mange inflation in the economy (due to external influences) as the option of sterilization and exchange rate management in not available.
Option 2: If we maintain free capital flows and have an independent monetary policy, then exchange rate will change. It cannot be stable.
Option 3: The same applies for the other option, we cannot have free capital flows, if exchange rate is fixed and monetary policy acts independently. It will block free flow of capital.

70 Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 2013 notified new norms for angel investors in India. Angel investors are those who
a)  Save a failed company from defaulting on credit obligations
b)  Provide funding to companies at their initial stages
c)  Takeover a company that is consistently running negative profits
d)  Provide financial advice and funding to any company run by a minority or socio-economically backward classes
Answer: B
Angel investor is an investor who provides financial backing to entrepreneurs for 'starting their business'. Angel investors are usually found among an entrepreneur's family and friends but they may be from outside also.
The capital they provide can be a one-time injection of seed money or ongoing support to carry the company through difficult times ' in exchange they may like owning share in the business or provide capital as loan (in case of a loan they lend at more favorable terms than other lenders, as they are usually investing in the person rather than the viability of the business).
User Name :      Kant
Other than investible capital, these investors provide technical advices and also help the 'start-up' business with their lucrative contacts.
They are focused on helping the business succeed, rather than reaping a huge profit from their investment.
Angel investors are essentially the exact opposite of a venture capitalist in their 'intention' (who has high profit prospects as their prime focus).

a)  Expenditure in the budget that is financed through tax receipts
b)  Revenue foregone on account of tax exemptions
c)  Expenditure incurred in administering and collecting taxes
d)  The part of tax receipts that are diverted to plan expenditure
Answer: B
 There is significant divergence in India between the official rates of taxes and the actual or effective rate of taxation (which is a simple 'ratio of tax revenue collected to the tax base').
This arises on account of the exemptions to the tax rate. As indicated earlier in the section on collection rates, the magnitude of revenue foregone (i.e. tax expenditure) is indeed high.

83 A Balance of Payments (BoP) crisis is a situation when
a)  A nation's current account transactions supersede capital account transactions
b)  A nation is not receiving enough foreign investment even when GDP is stagnating
c)  A nation is unable to pay a negative BoP by its Forex reserves
d)  A nation's Forex reserves fail to be useful for sterilization
Answer: C
 We have already covered this topic in the past 
The outcome of the total transactions of an economy with the outside world in one year is known as the balance of payment (BoP) of the economy.
Basically, it is the net outcome of the current and capital accounts of an economy. It might be favourable or unfavourable for the economy.
Even if current accounts transactions supersede capital account, what matter is its magnitude and if it is surplus or deficit.
However, negativity of the BoP does not mean it is unfavourable. A negative BoP is unfavourable for an economy if only the economy lacks the means to fill the gap of negativity.
If there is a positive outcome at the end of the year, the money is automatically transferred to the foreign exchange reserves of the economy. And if there is any negative outcome, the same foreign exchange is drawn from the country's forex reserves. If the forex reserves are not capable of fulfilling the negativity created by the BoP, it is known as a BoP crisis

a)  Coral reefs
b)  Mycorrhizae
c)  Blue-green algae
d)  Hard outer skeleton of shellfish
Answer: D
 The chitosan has been obtained naturally from the hard outer skeleton of shellfish including crab, lobster, and shrimp as a backbone for the carbon nanoparticles to sit on. In this biopolymer, nanoparticles are the functional parts of the technology as they remove calcium and magnesium components of water through ion exchange.
Thus, it shows the same process that is used by common water purifiers.
It is significant because this natural material is the first of its kind with potential to act as a biodegradable and green material for water-softening applications.

Statement R: However, there is definitely a need to ensure harmony and balance between the recommendations of all finance commissions as:
Both recommend devolution of funds to PRIs (for e.g. 14th UFC).
Both take into account the fiscal situation of the state before recommending any such outlays.
UFC is mandated to suggest the measures needed to augment the consolidated fund of a state to supplement the resources of the panchayats in the states (on the basis of the recommendations made by the finance commission of the state).

limited stock of Government Securities and impaired the scope for similar interventions in the future.
Under this scheme, the GoI borrows from the RBI (such borrowing being additional to its normal borrowing requirements) and issues Treasury-Bills/Dated Securities that are utilized for absorbing excess liquidity from the market.

The securities issued under MSS, termed as Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) Securities/Bonds, are issued by way of auctions conducted by the RBI and are done according to a specified ceiling mutually agreed upon by the GoI and the RBI.
