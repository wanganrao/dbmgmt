1 The Natya Shashtra is a notable ancient treatise influencing dance, music and literary traditions in India. It is notable for its aesthetic "Rasa theory". What does the theory assert?
a)  Performance of arts is intended purely for entertainment
b)  Pleasure and happiness are the foundations of a human's life.
c)  The primary goal of ragas in music is to give it a natural flavour, one that appeals to all creatures and not only human beings
d)  Performance of arts is a tool to raise individual consciousness for spiritual
upliftment
Answer: D
 It asserts that entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and that the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder, where he experiences the essence of his own consciousness, and reflects on spiritual and moral questions
This is similar to the Sufi's views on music, chanting and its spiritual potential to connect with the divine.

2 Consider the following statements
1.  Assertion (a): Ozone depletion over the South Pole is greater than ozone depletion over the North Pole.
2.  Reason (R): South Pole is colder then North Pole
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  Both A and R are incorrect
Answer: A
 The ozone hole is caused due to reaction of chlorine monoxide and diatomic oxygen. These are produced when CFCs are hit by ultraviolet light.
Lower temperatures favor the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) which serve as platforms for catalytic ozone breakdown
Unlike the Arctic, the circulation over the Antarctic is more persistent and vortex- like as a consequence of having less land. So, Antarctica is colder than the Arctic circle.
Therefore ozone depletion over the South Pole is greater than ozone depletion over the North Pole

4 How do global warming and climate change threaten mangroves?
1.  Rising sea level will submerge mangroves.
2.  Wave action that sustains the nutrient flow to mangroves will be reduced drastically.
3.  Increasing salinity of shore waters will make mangrove survival difficult.
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: B
 Mangroves play a critical role in protecting lives and property in low- lying coastal areas from storm surges, which are expected to increase with global warming.
Rising sea levels and changing salinity pose the most serious threats to these ecosystems
Where mangroves are sheltered by coral reefs killed by global warming, damage to mangroves from increased wave action is expected to rise. So, 3 is incorrect.

5 Consider the following statements.
1.  Arunachal Pradesh finds mention in the literature of Kalika Purana and Mahabharata
2.  Bihar finds mention in the Vedas and Puranas
3.  Chhattisgarh, known as Dakshin-Kausal, finds mention in Ramayana and
Mahabharata.
Select the correct answer using the codes below

6 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): India imports the paper required for printing currency notes
2.  Reason (R): Due to security reasons, no paper mill in India prints paper for producing currency notes.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect
d)  A is incorrect, but R is correct
Answer: C
 While we are wholly self reliant in the printing of currency notes, we are largely dependent on imports for meeting the paper requirements.
Presently, the annual requirement of paper for printing of Banknotes is around 18,000 tonnes for printing of around 15-16 billion pieces of notes, with 95% of this being imported from foreign suppliers.
This requirement is expected to increase further which implies that in the absence of adequate domestic manufacturing capacity, our dependence on imports will increase.
There are many security Paper Mills in India including the one at Mysore, Karnataka established recently. So, R is wrong.
Besides, on account of increase in demand of banknote paper globally, without corresponding increase in the production capacity of paper, the
country may soon face a situation of shrinking supplies and concomitant
higher prices
In 2015, a conference on the need for Indigenisation of Paper, INK and Security
Features of Indian Currency was organized

8 As a policymaker, you would recommend a surplus budget to government during a phase of
a)  Economic Recovery
b)  Economic Boom
c)  Economic Depression
d)  Famines
Answer: B
  A boom is a period of rapid economic expansion resulting in higher GDP, lower unemployment and rising asset prices. Booms usually suggest the economy is overheating creating inflationary pressures.
When the economy is overheating, further fiscal stimulus or a deficit budget will infuse greater money supply in the economy. This will lead to higher demand and further overheating. So, a surplus budget is recommended in this case
In other cases (a), (c) and (d), a deficit budget is recommended

9 "Popular sovereignty" implies
1.  People are the ultimate source of the authority of their government.
2.  A region can be declared sovereign by the wish of the people.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Popular sovereignty is a basic idea of democracyv
In a democracy, political authority flows from the people to the government-not from government to the People.
Popular sovereignty means that the government can only exercise authority if it has been given permission to do so by the People. Therefore, popular sovereignty limits the powers of government

10 As per the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the responsibility for recognition and vesting of forest rights and distribution of land rights rests with the
a)  District Collector
b)  State Government
c)  Central Government
d)  Chief Wildlife Warden of the forest region
Answer: B
 It seeks to recognize the forest rights and occupation in forest land of old forest dwellers. They chose rights on ancestral lands and their habitat were not adequately recognized in the consolidation of State forests during the colonial period as well as in independent India.
Section 6(1) of the Act provides that the gram sabha, or village assembly, will initially pass a resolution recommending whose rights to which resources should be recognised (i.e. which lands belong to whom, how much land was under the cultivation of each person
This resolution is then screened and approved at the level of the sub-division (or taluka) and subsequently at the district level. The screening committees consist of three government officials (Forest, Revenue and Tribal Welfare departments) and three elected members of the local body at that level.
The state government finally recognizes and vests the forest rights.

11 The Round Table conference resulted from a review of the Government of India Act of
1919 by the Simon Commission (1927). Consider the following about it

c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
 Round Table Conference, (1930-32) were a series of meetings in
three sessions called by the British government to consider the future constitution of
India
The conference resulted from a review of the Government of India Act of
1919, undertaken in 1927 by the Simon Commission, whose report was published in 1930
The first session had 73 representatives, from all Indian states and all parties except the Indian National Congress, which was waging a civil disobedience campaign against the government
Its principal achievement was an insistence on parliamentarianism-an acceptance by all, including the princes, of the federal principle-and on dominion status as the goal of constitutional development.
The second session was attended by Mahatma Gandhi as the Congress representative; it failed to reach agreement, either constitutionally or on communal representation
The third session was shorter and less important, with neither the Congress nor the British Labour Party attending.
The result of these deliberations was the Government of India Act, 1935, establishing provincial autonomy and also a federal system that was never implemented.

12 Which of the following is the most productive ecosystem?
a)  Estuaries
b)  Grasslands
c)  Deep Ocean
d)  Continental Shelves
Answer: A
 Because of differences in the availabilities of solar radiation, water, and nutrients, the world's ecosystems differ greatly in the amount of productivity that they sustain
Deserts, tundra, and the deep ocean are the least productive ecosystems, Grasslands, montane and boreal forests, waters of the continental shelf, and rough agriculture typically have slightly more productivity
Moist forests, moist prairies, shallow lakes, and typical agricultural systems have higher productivities
The most productive ecosystems are fertile estuaries and marshes, coral reefs, terrestrial vegetation on moist alluvial deposits and intensive agriculture.

13 Hydrogen peroxide is seen as the safest natural sanitizer and an environmentally safe alternative to other bleaches because
a)  It degrades to form oxygen and water
b)  It releases only free radicals upon reaction with unsterile objects.
c)  It is renewable
d)  It does not kill bacteria in the process of sterilization thus maintaining
bacterial diversity
Answer: A
 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the only germicidal agent composed only of water and oxygen. Like ozone, it kills disease organisms by oxidation.
Hydrogen peroxide kills microorganisms by oxidizing them, which can be best described as a controlled burning process
When Hydrogen peroxide reacts with organic material it breaks down into oxygen and water, meaning it is non-toxic for general use.
It can be helpful in cuts and infections, Foot Fungus, Sinus Infections etc.

17 In a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium market price of goods is determined by
a)  The government
b)  Considerations of marginal cost and revenue
c)  The buyers
d)  Total capital output
Answer: B
 There are a very large number of buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market.
Marginal cost means the cost of producing one additional unit of product. Marginal revenue is the price that every additional unit will fetch in the market.This is based on the demand of the buyers.
The equilibrium market price of goods is a point where marginal cost becomes equal to the marginal revenue.
This is one the most fundamental concepts of economic theory and used by many industrial firms in deciding the amount of output and prices. UPSC has asked questions on the "marginal concept", hence the question

19 Heavy water (Deuterium oxide) is used as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors. How is heavy water different from ordinary water?
1.  It is highly acidic in nature unlike ordinary water.
2.  It is radioactive unlike ordinary water
3.  Boiling point of hard water is higher than ordinary water
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  1 and 2 only
c)  3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: C
 Statement 1: pH of heavy water is around 7.43, whereas that of normal water is around 7. So, it is slightly more basic in nature
Statement 2: Deuterium oxide is not radioactive. However, tritiated water (water containing the tritium isotope of hydrogen) is also a form of heavy water. This type of heavy water is radioactive. It's also much more rare and more expensive. It is produced naturally (very rarely) by cosmic rays and by man in nuclear reactors.
Statement 3: Both boiling and freezing points are slightly higher than ordinady water.

 The Kailasa Temple is a megalith carved out of one single rock and considered as one of the most remarkable cave temples in India because of its size,
architecture and sculptural treatment
It is notable for its vertical excavation - carvers started at the top of the original rock, and excavated downward. The traditional methods were rigidly followed by the master architect which could not have been achieved by excavating from the front
Its construction is generally attributed to the 8th century Rashtrakuta king Krishna I. The temple architecture shows traces of Pallava style.

22 The 2014 North American cold wave was an extreme weather event which saw record low temperatures for months together. It was caused due to?
a)  Southward shift of the North Polar Vortex
b)  Depletion of stratospheric ozone layer
c)  Massive deforestation of boreal forests in Alaska and nearby regions
d)  Northward shift of cold currents
Answer: A
  There are two polar vortices in the Earth's atmosphere, which overlie the North, and South Poles.
Each polar vortex is a persistent, large-scale, low pressure zone that rotates counter- clockwise at the North Pole (called a cyclone), and clockwise at the South Pole.
The bases of the two polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and extend into the stratosphere.
Beneath that lies a large mass of cold, dense arctic air. The vortices weaken and strengthen from year to year.
Northern polar vortex's southward shift will bring heavily cold weather in the northern regions

26 Consider the following about Dark Energy
1.  It is distributed evenly throughout the universe.
2.  It tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe

3.  It makes for a very tiny part of the universe
Select the correct answer using the codes below
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing. Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be understood. The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence.
Dark energy makes up approximately 68% of the universe and appears to be associated with the vacuum in space
It is distributed evenly throughout the universe, not only in space but also in time - in other words, its effect is not diluted as the universe expands.
The even distribution means that dark energy does not have any local gravitational effects, but rather a global effect on the universe as a whole. This leads to a repulsive force, which tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe
The rate of expansion and its acceleration can be measured by observations based on the Hubble law

27 Consider the following statements.

29 The Third Battle of Panipat had which of the following consequences?
1.  Consolidation of power of East India Company in Bengal
2.  Afghans made inroads in Western and Central India
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
 Marathas were defeated by Afghans in the Battle of Panipat. The result of the battle was the halting of further Maratha advances in the north, and a destabilization of their territories, for roughly 10 years
The Third Battle of Panipat altered the power equations in India but not necessarily in a predictable manner. The victorious Afghans could hardly make any further inroads into India and were even pushed out of Punjab by the Sikhs.
Bipin Chandra writes: The Maratha defeat at Panipat was a disaster for them. They lost the cream of their army and their political prestige suffered a big blow. Most of all, their defeat gave an opportunity to the English East India Company to consolidate its power in Bengal and south India
Nor did the Afghans benefit from their victory ... In fact, the (battle] did not decide who was to rule India but rather who was not. The way was, therefore, cleared for the rise of the British power in India."

35 Mixed farming is the practice of
a)  Rotating crops at frequent intervals
b)  Growing a variety of crops in the same field in the same season
c)  Growing one or more vegetable crops on a large scale for shipment to distant markets
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
 Option (a) is crop rotation Option (b) is similar to mixed cropping. Option (c) is truck farming
Mixed farming system mixes arable farming with the raising of livestock at the same time, e.g. poultry, bee-keeping etc
Combining crops and livestock also has the potential to maintain ecosystem function and health and help prevent agricultural systems from becoming too brittle, or over connected, by promoting greater biodiversity, and therefore increased capability to absorb shocks to the natural resource base

36 Which of the following regions is known for "frontal cyclones"?
a)  Tropical regions
b)  Equatorial regions
c)  Polar regions
d)  Mid-latitude regions
Answer: D
 In tropical regions, tropical cyclones are more common. So, (a) is less appropriate than (d).
Mid-latitude or frontal cyclones are large traveling atmospheric cyclonic storms up to 2000 kilometers in diameter with centers of low atmospheric pressure.
Mid-latitude cyclones are the result of the dynamic interaction of warm tropical and
cold polar air masses at the polar front.
This interaction causes the warm air to be cyclonically lifted vertically into the atmosphere where it combines with colder upper atmosphere air. This process also helps to transport excess energy from the lower latitudes to the higher latitudes.

44 Consider the following with reference to the Land Boundary Agreement (LBa) between
India and Bangladesh in 2015.
1.  Implementation of the agreement required a constitutional amendment.
2.  The agreement will help curb illegal migration as it settles the long stranded boundary.
3.  It will help the stateless citizens living in former enclaves by granting the citizenship from their respective countries.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 only
Answer: D
The LBA envisages a notional transfer of 111 Indian enclaves to
Bangladesh in return of 51 enclaves to India.
In totality India incurs a net loss in terms of area occupancy.
This remained a major concern of opposition from the north-eastern affected states and west Bengal.
Also, most of the area concerned is occupied by the tribals of the NE states and hence the swapping takes away their land rights leaving them more vulnerable.
However, these are remote enclaves which India cannot access. This legislation will redraw India's boundary with Bangladesh by exchanging enclaves in Assam, West Bengal, Tripura and Meghalaya.
The 119th constitutional amendment bill 2013 sought to ratify the land boundary agreement between the two countries.
It would help settle the boundary dispute at several points in Meghalaya, Tripura, Assam, and west Bengal.
It would improve the access to the underdeveloped north-eastern state and would further enhance the developmental works in the region.
It would help to increase the connectivity with the south-east Asia as part of
India's North-eastern policy.

Taxes on capital value of assets of individual and companies. Fees on matters of the Union list.

47 The recent increase in ice cover over Antarctica has been attributed by researchers to
a)  Climate change
b)  Gulf Stream cold current
c)  Formation of polar vortex
d)  Geology of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean
Answer: D
 
The inverse phenomenon for this rise of the sea ice cover was observed due to geology of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
Two persistent geological factors for the rise were the topography of
Antarctica and the depth of the ocean surrounding it.
These two geological factors are influencing ocean currents and winds to drive the formation and evolution of Antarctica's sea ice cover and help sustain it.
In this inverse phenomenon, sea ice forms and builds up early in the sea ice growth season
This ice later due to winds gets pushed offshore and northward forming a protective shield of thicker, older ice that circulates around the continent. The persistent winds flowing down slope off the continent plays important
role in piling of ice up against the massive ice shield, enhancing its thickness. This ice drifts away from the continent as the sea ice cover expands creating ice factories conducive to rapid sea ice growth.

a)  Red light is scattered the least by air molecules.
b)  Scattering in yellow light is less than red.
c)  Red light contains more photons than yellow light.
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
 Red, having the higher wavelength is the least scattered. So, it can travel longer distances without appreciable loss by scattering than any other colored lights.
Also, we inherently perceive red colour associated with danger.
Colours such as blue are scattered most and not visible from a distance.

It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music and theater during the period of the Bhakti movement.
A typical Yakshagana performance consists of background music played by a group of musicians (known as the himmela); and a dance and dialog group (known as the mummela), who together enact poetic epics onstage.
It consists of a story teller (the bhagvatha) who narrates the story by singing (which includes prepared character dialogues) as the actors dance to the music, portraying elements of the story as it is being narrated.

53 How will full convertibility of Indian currency affect the economy?
1.  It will secure the economy against any global liquidity shock.
2.  It will help stabilize exchange rate of rupee.
3.  It will attract more foreign capital in India.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  1 and 3 only
Answer: C
Concept:Capital account convertibility means the freedom to convert rupees into foreign currency and back for capital transactions. India has current account convertibility but not capital account convertibility
 If foreign investors could convert Indian currency to foreign currency and vice versa easily, it will lead to higher flight or investment of FII in India.
FII is speculative and brings little good for the country. It will make the exchange rate even more volatile and further subject the economy to global liquidity risks like the 2008 crisis.
However, due to the ease of convertibility, it will definitely attract more foreign capital in India.

54 In literature, the first references to dance and music in India can be found in
a)  Vedas
b)  Aranyakas
c)  Natyadharmi
d)  Nandikesvara
Answer: A
Bharata and Nandikesvara are the main authorities of dance, not the first references.
Aranyakas are the Philosophy behind ritual sacrifice part of the Vedas. Natyadharmi is the formalised presentation of theatre.
So, (a) can be the only answer.
The first references come from the Vedas where dance and music have their roots. A more consistent history of dance can be reconstructed from the epics,
the several Puranas and the rich body of dramatic and poetic literature known as the
nataka and the kavya in Sanskrit.

55 Consider the following about the HRIDAY- Heritage City Development and
Augmentation Yojana scheme.
1.  It will focus on improving physical and institutional infrastructure in selected cities.
2.  The scheme is funded jointly by the Central government, State Governments and
Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
3.  All regions developed under the scheme should be either a UNESCO heritage site or would have been nominated by the GoI for such consideration.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  1 only
d)  1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
Statement 1: It aims to bring urban planning, economic growth and heritage conservation together for heritage cities.
It also seeks beautification in an inclusive and integrated manner with focus on cleanliness, livelihoods, skills, safety, security, accessibility and faster service delivery of heritage cities.
Statement 2: HRIDAY is a central sector scheme, where 100% funding will be provided by Government of India.
Statement 3: As a pilot, this flagship scheme of the government focuses on revitalising twelve heritage cities, namely Amrawati (Andhra Pradesh), Gaya (Bihar), Dwaraka (Gujarat), Badami (Karnataka), Puri (Odisha), Amritsar (Punjab), Ajmer (Rajasthan), Kanchipuram and Velankanni (Tamil Nadu), Warrangal (Telangana) and Mathura and Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh).
The requirement in statement 3 is not provided for in the scheme.
HRIDAY will be dovetailed with the Tourism Ministry's Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive Drive (PRASAD) scheme which has an outlay of Rs 100 crore for augmentation of infrastructure at pilgrimage sites across the
country.

56 Acharya Vinoba Bhave was the first Individual Satyagrahi. He did Satyagraha in which of the following ways?
a)  He made an anti-war speech.
b)  He burnt the British Flag.
c)  He did not pay taxes.
d)  He wrote an article against the Viceroy of India.
Answer: A
 The Congress was in a confused state again after the August Offer.
The radicals and leftists wanted to launch a mass Civil Disobedience
Movement, but here Gandhi insisted on Individual Satyagraha.
The Individual Satyagraha was not to seek independence but to affirm the right of speech.
The other reason of this Satyagraha was that a mass movement may turn violent and he would not like to see the Great Britain embarrassed by such a situation.
The first Satyagrahi selected was Acharya Vinoba Bhave, who was sent to Jail when he spoke against the war.
Second Satyagrahi was Jawahar Lal Nehru.
Third was Brahma Datt, one of the inmates of the Gandhi's Ashram. They all were sent to jails for violating the Defense of India Act.

58 As per the ideology of communism, what is not good for the state?
a)  Use of Machines in production
b)  Ideological systems
c)  Surplus production
d)  Private property
Answer: D
 Communism, the political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society.
Some theories of Communism hold that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the mode of production, and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by class struggle.
• According to this analysis, the Industrial Revolution ushered the world into
a new mode of production: capitalism, which divided the society in two
classes – the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

59 The Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) intends to deliver integrated project based infrastructure in the rural areas also including development of economic activities and skill development. What does the "Rurban" in the scheme stands for?
a)  Village in transition to town
b)  Sub-urban areas
c)  Model villages
d)  A cluster of 15-20 geographically contiguous villages
Answer: D
 The Mission aims at development of rural growth clusters which have latent potential for growth, in all States and Union Territories (UTs), which would trigger overall development in the region.
These clusters would be developed by provisioning of economic activities, developing skills & local entrepreneurship and providing infrastructure amenities. The Rurban Mission will thus develop a cluster of Smart Villages. For the purposes of SPMRM, Rurban areas refer to a cluster of 15-20 villages having about 30 to 40 lakh population. The clusters will be geographically contiguous Gram Panchayats with a population of about 25000 to 50000 in plain and coastal areas and a population of 5000 to 15000 in desert, hilly or tribal areas.
The preferred mode of delivery is through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)
while using various scheme funds for financing.

60 The term "Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)" often in news is related to
a)  Infrastructure financing
b)  Fund for poverty alleviation
c)  Climate change
d)  Peace Keeping Forces in conflict-ridden zones
Answer: C
 Countries across the globe committed to create a new international climate agreement by the conclusion of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015.
In preparation, countries had agreed to publicly outline what post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under a new international agreement, known as their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).
The process for INDCs pairs national policy-setting - in which countries determine their contributions in the context of their national priorities, circumstances and capabilities - with a global framework that drives collective action toward a low- carbon, climate-resilient future.

61 The "Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement" signed by India with other countries has a bearing on which of the following in India?
a)  Foreign Institutional Investment
b)  Foreign Direct Investment
c)  Bilateral Trade
d)  External Commercial Borrowing
Answer: B
DTAA aims at avoiding taxing a company doubly by both the host nation and the home nation.
For e.g. Suppose Apple, a US based company wants to invest and operate in India.c
If both countries charge it at the normal corporate tax rates, the company will end up paying at least 60% of its profits as taxes.
To avoid this situation, countries enter into DTAA and agree for a reasonable mutual division of taxes.

62 Bicameralism can exist in which of the following systems of governance?
a)  Federal System
b)  Parliamentary System
c)  Unitary Government

 Bicameralism is the practice of having two legislative or parliamentary chambers.
Some countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, Switzerland, Nigeria, and the United States, link their bicameral systems to their federal political structure.
Many bicameral countries like the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland and Romania are examples of bicameral systems existing in unitary states.
In countries such as these, the upper house generally focuses on scrutinizing and possibly vetoing the decisions of the lower house.
In a few countries, bicameralism involves the juxtaposition of democratic and aristocratic elements.
Hence, all options are correct.

63 The printing of one-rupee notes was discontinued in 1994 because of high printing cost as compared to their lives. However, subsequent to a gazette-notification in December
2014 one-rupee notes were re-issued. One rupee notes bear the signature of?
a)  President of India
b)  Governor, Reserve Bank of India
c)  Finance Secretary, Government of India
d)  Chairman, Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India (SPMCIL)
Answer: C
The cost of printing one rupee note is Rs 1.14, more than its value. Due to the high printing costs and short lives, it was discontinued.
The denominations had been coinised in these 20 years gap. However, the Union
Finance Ministry recently re-introduced it.
Unlike other currency notes which the bear signature of RBI Governor, the one rupee notes has signature of the Finance Secretary. It is because oone-rupee notes are not issued by the RBI governor.

64 Which is of the following subjects is NOT the concern of a local government in India?
a)  Public Utility Services
b)  Law and Order

Twenty-nine subjects (of 11th Schedule of the Constitution), which were earlier in the State list, were transferred to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (optionally) by the
73rd amendment, such as animal husbandry, local markets etc.
The functions of Urban local bodies have been listed in the Twelfth Schedule of the Constitution, such as maintenance of public parks, street lighting, drainage and sewerage etc.

65 Earth's atmosphere consists of several layers. But, troposphere is the hot
a)  It is closest to the thermosphere.
b)  It contains charged particles that trap the solar insolation.
c)  It is heated by the Earth's surface.
d)  It is the only atmospheric layer that generates heat other than absorbing it via
different sources.
Answer: C
Charged particles are in ionosphere. So, (b) is incorrect.
The troposphere is heated from below. Sunlight warms the ground or ocean, which in turn radiates the heat into the air right above it. This warm air tends to rise. That keeps the air in the troposphere "stirred up".
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere
Almost all weather occurs within this layer. Air is warmest at the bottom of the troposphere near ground level. Higher up it gets colder
Nearly all of the water vapour and dust particles in the atmosphere are in the troposphere. That is why most clouds are found in this lowest layer, too.

66 Which of the following fix the maximum solar insolation available?
a)  Green plants
b) Bacteria
c) Protozoa
d)  Fungi
Answer: A
Fungi are not primary producers, so they cannot fix solar insolation, (d) is incorrect.
Only few bacteria are primary producers, so (b) is also incorrect. Green plants fix solar energy in the process of photosynthesis.
Photosynthetic energy capture is estimated to be ten times that of global annual energy consumption. However, only a small part of this solar radiation is used for photosynthesis.

67 Liability and the ultimate burden of a direct tax lies on
a)  The income tax department
b)  Intermediaries involved in the process
c)  Person or entity on which it is imposed
d)  Persons or entities other than on which it has been imposed
Answer: C
Broadly, there are two types of taxes that the Indian government levies on its citizens - direct tax and indirect tax.
Direct taxes are those which are paid directly to the government by the taxpayer. These taxes are not paid deducted and paid on behalf of the taxpayer. It's imposed on the people and organizations directly by the government.
This tax liability has to be paid by the taxpayer in question and cannot be transferred to any other entity for payment. Examples include corporation tax, income tax, and social security contributions.
Direct taxation in India is overseen by the Central Board of Direct Taxes or the
CBDT.

68 A redistribution of income in a country can be best brought about through
1.  Progressive taxation
2.  Progressive expenditure
3.  Regressive expenditure
4.  Regressive taxation
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 4 only
c)  1 and 3 only
d)  3 and 4
Answer: A
 Progressive taxation taxes the rich more than the poor in order to redistribute income to reduce inequality.
Public expenditure redistributes taxed income from the rich in favour of the
poor strata of the society
Public expenditure by its nature may be progressive or regressive. An expenditure which yields greater benefits to the poor is regarded as progressive.
Old age pension, free education to economically weaker sections, subsidies to essential goods of mass consumption, etc. are progressive expenditure. Progressive public expenditure only reduces inequalities of income distribution.
A regressive expenditure which confers larger benefits to the richer sections, e.g. provision of subsidised milk in rich localities or subsidies on luxury goods, etc. tends to widen the gap of inequalities.

69 What is/are the crucial difference(s) between first generation biofuels and Second generation biofuels?
1.  Feedstock used in producing second generation biofuels are generally not food crops.
2.  Bacteria are used to obtain fuel from first generation crops, whereas only Lichens can be used for second generation crops.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: A
Second generation biofuels are also known as advanced biofuels. What separates them from first generation biofuels the fact that feedstock used in producing second generation biofuels are generally not food crops.
The only time the food crops can act as second generation biofuels is if they have already fulfilled their food purpose. For instance, waste vegetable oil is a second generation biofuels because it has already been used and is no longer fit for human consumption. Virgin vegetable oil, however, would be a first generation biofuel.
Because second generation biofuels are derived from different feed stock, Different technology is often used to extract energy from them such as Thermochemical
Conversion, Biochemical Conversion using bacteria etc.

83 The vast majority of the world's human population resides in
a)  Temperate zone including the subtropics
b)  Equator
c)  Southern tropical regions
d)  Southern frigid zone
Answer: A
Majority resides in temperate zones (if defined as comprising the subtropics as well), especially in the northern hemisphere because of its greater mass of land.
The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate. This is another reason for majority settlements.
However, in certain areas, such as Asia and central North America, the variations between summer and winter can be extreme because these areas are far away from the sea, causing them to have a continental climate.

84 The fact that Chennai is warmer than Kolkata can be attributed to
a)  Latitude
b)  Altitude
c)  Distance from sea
d)  Monsoon effects
Answer: A
Chennai being closer to the equator receives greater solar insolation than Calcutta; hence the warmth.
The difference in altitude is not considerable to cause noticeable variations in temperature. Moreover, both are coastal cities. So, (b) and (c) are wrong.
It is correct that Chennai does not receive a lot of rainfall from the South-west Monsoon winds, and that does not allow Chennai to cool in late summer. But, here (a) is a more appropriate option as monsoon lasts only for 2 months whereas the temperature effects can be noticed year round.

85 Chisti is a Sufi order having its beginning in Afghanistan. Which of the following practices would NOT be approved by the Chistis and why?

c)  Several days of lonely spiritual confinement since it is against human nature.
d)  They approve of all the above practices and the reasons given above are not
objected to by the Chistis.
Answer: D
They approved all these practise as Sufis also did.
The founder of the Chishti Order in South Asia was Moinuddin Chishti
Several rulers of the Mughal dynasty of South Asia were Chisti devotees. The emperor Akbar was perhaps the most fervent of them.
However, the Chishti shaykhs have stressed the importance of keeping a distance from worldly power Chishti believe that this insistence on otherworldliness differentiates them from Sufi orders that maintained close ties to rulers and courts.

c)  He cannot vote in his coalition's favour in a no-confidence motion.
d)  He must become a member of the Lower House within six months after being sworn-in as the Prime Minister.
Answer: C
A no-confidence motion is introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha. It is a 
Even though PM can attend the meetings of Lok Sabha, it is only the members of
Lok Sabha who can vote on such a motion.
Therefore, in his first tenure Shri Manmohan Singh could not have voted in case of a no-confidence motion.

88 "Duke Memorandum" formulated by Frederick William Duke intended to
a)  Organize referendum in freedom seeking provinces
b)  Design a responsible government based on diarchy in India
c)  Restrict the entry of Indians in the Civil Services
d)  Giving the Governor-General a more pro-active role in the princely states
Answer: B
Duke was the last lieutenant-governor of Bengal.
Duke joined a study group of India Office members and the Round Table Group [6] founded by Lionel George Curtis which had a lot of influence on Indian constitutional reforms.
In this capacity he formulated the "Duke Memorandum" in which he devised a practical scheme of reforms relating to how the Indians could implement responsible government by means of diarchy.
Duke's long experience in India had lent authority to the Round table reform schemes and his memorandum formed the basis of the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms and the subsequent Government of India Act of 1919.
After the 1919 Act was given royal assent the Chamber of Princes was established in 1920 to provide a forum for the rulers of the princely states to have a say in the government of British India. Duke was the chairman of the committee that was ultimately responsible for bringing the chamber into existence.

89 Which among the following was NOT a provision of Charter act of 1833?
a)  An Indian should be appointed as defence member in the Governor General in Council.
b)  Trading activities of the East India Company were to be abolished
c)  The designation of the supreme authority was to be changed as the Governor
General of India in Council.
d)  All law making powers were to be conferred on Governor General in council.
Answer: A
 Macaulay was Secretary to the Board of Control from 1832 until
1833.
He could not have provided for the association of Indians directly with the British administration. So, the answer can be easily arrived at as (a).
However, the act opened civil services competition to Indians also.
Via this act, the charter was renewed for 20 years but the East India Company was deprived of its commercial privileges which it enjoyed so far.
This act made the Governor General of Bengal the Governor General of British
India and all financial and administrative powers were centralized in the hands of
Governor General-in-Council.

90 Consider the following about the process of "Dark fermentation"
1.  It can be achieved by fungi only.
2.  It may be used to safely dispose radioactive wastes.
3.  It can be used to fight global warming as it reduces the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  3 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: D
Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, or alcohol.
Dark fermentation is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen. It is a complex process manifested by diverse groups of bacteria.
Biohydrogen is defined as hydrogen produced biologically, most commonly by algae, bacteria and archaea. Biohydrogen is a potential biofuel obtainable from both cultivation and from waste organic materials.
Dark fermentation differs from photofermentation in that it proceeds without the presence of light.
Utilization of wastewater as a potential substrate for biohydrogen production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process.

91 Therukoothu is one of the most popular forms of folk drama of Tamil Nadu. It is performed to
a)  Explain the nature of the eternal cycle of life and death
b)  Placate spirits and unnatural forces
c)  Celebrate community reunion every year before summer
d)  Achieve rich harvest
Answer: D
It is mostly performed at the time of annual temple festivals of
Mariamman (Rain goddess) to achieve rich harvest.
At the core of the extensive repertoire of Therukoothu there is a cycle of eight plays based on the life of Draupadi.
Kattiakaran, the Sutradhara of the Therukoothu performance, gives the gist of the play to the audience and Komali entertains the audience with his buffoonery.
It is very popular among the rural areas and has remained relatively unchanged even in modern times.

92 Consider the following statements.
1.  Assertion (a): Instruments can be shielded from outside magnetic effects by surrounding them with soft-Iron shield.
2.  Reason (R): Iron absorbs and distorts the magnetic field around it.
In the context of the above, which of these is correct?
a)  A is correct, and R is an appropriate explanation of A.
b)  A is correct, but R is not an appropriate explanation of A.
c)  A is correct, but R is incorrect.
d)  A is incorrect, but R is correct.
Answer: C
There is no known insulator for magnetic flux.
If a magnetic material (for example, soft iron) is placed in a magnetic field, the flux may be redirected to take advantage of the greater permeability of the magnetic material.
The sensitive mechanisms of electric instruments and meters can be
influenced by stray magnetic fields which will cause errors in their readings. Because instrument mechanisms cannot be insulated against magnetic flux, it is necessary to employ some means of directing the flux around the instrument.
This is accomplished by placing a soft-iron case, called a magnetic screen or shield, about the instrument. Because the flux is established more readily through the iron (even though the path is longer) than through the air inside the case, the instrument is effectively shielded.

93 Annexation of Awadh by the British was a major factor that fuelled the 1857 Munity. It was annexed on the grounds of
a)  Failure to pay subsidiary alliance dues
b)  Doctrine of Lapse
c)  Alleged misgovernment
d)  Doctrine of paramountcy and maintenance of relations with foreign powers
Answer: C
Under the Doctrine of Lapse Dalhousie annexed Satara, Jaitpur, Sambalpur, Bhagat, Udaipur, Jhansi and Nagpur.
During the time of Lord Dalhousie many small and big Kingdoms were added to the
British territory.
The Nawabs of Oudh were the faithful allies of the English. Dalhousie was determined to annex Oudh on whatever ground. At last towards the close of his rule he brought serious charges against the ruling Nawab Wazid Ali that his administration had become a complete misrule.
The Nawab was forced to vacate his throne and Dalhousie annexed Oudh on
February 1856. This annexation of Oudh was an example of reckless imperialism.

94 Who among the following enjoys the rank and pay of a Cabinet minister?

Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 only
b)  3 and 4 only
c)  1 and 2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: A
 Historically, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission had a cabinet rank and its full-time members had the rank of minister of state.
However, in 2015, PMO clarified that the Vice-Chairperson of NITI Aayog will enjoy the status of a cabinet minister and members the rank of a Minister of State (MoS).
This allows the Vice-chairperson to attend cabinet meetings.

95 Consider the following about Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
1.  They contribute to ozone layer depletion.
2.  They can cause global warming
3.  HFCs are not covered under any international protocol.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  2 and 3 only
c)  2 only
d)  None of the above
Answer: C
Statement 1 and 2: Produced mostly in developed countries, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) replaced CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs pose no harm to the
ozone layer because, unlike CFCs and HCFCs, they do not contain chlorine.
Statement 3: The Montreal Protocol does not currently address HFCs, but these substances figure in the basket of six greenhouse gases under the Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries following the Kyoto Protocol report their HFC emission data to UNFCCC; parties to the Montreal Protocol have no such obligation.

96 The administration of Bengal was sharply divided between the company and the Nawab as per the "Dual Administration" system introduced by Robert Clives. Consider the following about it.
1.  The Nawab of Bengal was the incharge of civil and police administration.
2.  The English got the right of collecting the revenue but they had no responsibility for the internal administration.
Which of the above is/are correct?
a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: C
The principal aim of Clive was to make the Nawab a figurehead in the matter of administration by taking away from him all the powers.
For that purposes he was determined to give a clear meaning with regard to the relation between the Nawab of Bengal and East India Company and the company with the Emperor of Delhi.
He successfully persuaded the Nawab of Bengal to practically grant the company the Nizamat or military power and criminal justice in 1765. Wtihin six months, the Emperor Shah Alam granted to the company the Diwani or right to collect revenue from Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Thus, the
company remained in charge of army and revenue which added to its power and position.
The Nawab of Bengal remained charge of civil and police administration by receiving annually a sum of rupees 53 lakhs from the company.
Thus, the administration of Bengal was sharply divided between the company and the Nawab and was, therefore, called the Dual Government.

97 Consider the following about Dark Matter.
1.  It can interact with ordinary matter through gravity only.
2.  It does not interact with electromagnetic radiation.
3.  Much of the evidence of presence of dark matter comes from the motions of galaxies.
Select the correct answer using the codes below.
a)  1 and 2 only
b)  1 and 3 only
c)  2 and 3 only
d)  1, 2 and 3 Only
Answer: D
Unlike normal matter, dark matter does not interact with the electromagnetic force. This means it does not absorb, reflect or emit light, making it extremely hard to spot.
In fact, researchers have been able to infer the existence of dark matter only from the gravitational effect it seems to have on visible matter. Dark matter seems to outweigh visible matter roughly six to one, making up about 27% of the universe.
Statement 3: Galaxies in our universe seem to be achieving an impossible feat. They are rotating with such speed that the gravity generated by their observable matter could not possibly hold them together; they should have torn themselves apart long ago.
The same is true of galaxies in clusters, which leads scientists to believe that something we cannot see is at work. They think something we have yet to detect directly is giving these galaxies extra mass, generating the extra gravity they need to stay intact. This strange and unknown matter was called "dark matter" since it is not visible.

98 Consider the following about Bharatnatyam dance.
1.  The accompanying song while performing it is generally dedicated to good harvests.

a)  1 only
b)  2 only
c)  Both 1 and 2
d)  None
Answer: B
 As a solo dance, Bharatnatyam leans heavily on the abhinaya or mime aspect of dance - the nritya, where the dancer expresses the sahitya through movement and mime.
Statement 1: It is in the adoration of the Supreme Being.
Statement 2: It is a vibrant dance performed to the accompaniment of musical syllables with a few lines of sahitya.
The finale of the piece is a series of well designed rhythmic lines reaching a climax. The performance ends with a mangalam invoking the blessings of the Gods.

99 "Monetary transmission", frequently in news, refers to the process by which a central bank's monetary policy decisions are passed on to the financial markets. However, monetary transmission remains weak in India due to which of the following reason(s)?
a)  Globalized nature of financial institutions in India
b)  High volume of government borrowing
c)  High level of NPAs
d)  Both (b) and (c)
Answer: D
 A number of transmission channels have been identified: (a) the quantum channel (e.g., relating to money supply and credit); (b) the interest rate channel; (c) the exchange rate channel; and (d) the asset price channel.
How these channels function in a given economy depends on the stage of development of the economy and its underlying financial structure.
However, monetary transmission remains weak in India due to following reasons:
High volume of government borrowing (SLR mode)
Practice of yearly resetting of administered interest rates on small savings
(including public provident fund) linked to G-sec yields
Interest rate subventions,
High level of NPAs don't allow banks to cut interest rates. Sticky bank rates

Statement 4: Like any other plant, algae, when grown using sunlight, consume (or absorb) carbon dioxide (CO2) as they grow, releasing oxygen (O2) for the rest of us to breathe.
Statement 5: Algae thrive in nutrient-rich waters like municipal waste waters (sewage), animal wastes and some industrial effluents, at the same time purifying these wastes while producing a biomass suitable for biofuels production
Algae store energy in the form of oils and carbohydrates, which, combined with their high productivity, means they can produce from 2,000 to as many as 5,000 gallons of biofuels per acre per year.
