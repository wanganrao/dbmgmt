2.  Solution: d)

The layer of earth that is just below Lithosphere and goes deeper inside the surface is known as Asthenosphere. The balance between pressure and temperature is such that the rocks in this layer of the earth have little strength, and they behave like butter under a knife. This is the part of the mantle that slows down seismic waves as it consists of molten rocks

If we consider the entire mantle as whole, Asthenosphere comprises just over 6% in volume, but it is very important in tectonic plate movement as because of the liquidity of this layer, the overlying layer called Lithosphere is able to move.

What is the difference between Lithosphere and Asthenosphere?

• The difference between lithosphere and Asthenosphere pertain to their compositions.

• While lithosphere is hard and rigid, Asthenosphere is a layer made up of molten rocks.

• Lithosphere stretches from the top of the earth’s crust down to first 100 kilometers while
Asthenosphere lies beneath lithosphere

• Rocks are under severe pressure in Asthenosphere, whereas they face much less pressure in lithosphere.

• The mineral composition of lithosphere is varied as it contains more than 80 minerals whereas
Asthenosphere is mainly comprised of silicates of iron and magnesium.

• The depth of the lithosphere is about 100 kilometers, whereas the depth of Asthenosphere is 400-
700 kilometers.




3.  Solution: a)

Diastrophism refers to deformation of the Earth's crust, and more especially to folding and faulting. Diastrophism can be considered part of geo-tectonics. Diastrophism comes from the
Greek word meaning a twisting.

All processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth’s crust come under diastrophism. They include: (i) orogenic processes involving mountain building through severe folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth’s crust; (ii) epeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of the earth’s crust; (iii) earthquakes involving local relatively minor movements; (iv) plate tectonics involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.




4.  Solution: c)

President is a part of the Parliament. But he only addresses the Parliament (does not take part in the proceedings).

Attorney general can do so. He also enjoys all the privileges and immunities available to the MPs. CAG only guides the PAC in ensuring the accountability of the executive to the Parliament.



5.  Solution: a)

The importance of the traditions of the Alvars and Nayanars was sometimes indicated by the claim that their compositions were as important as the Vedas.

For instance, one of the major anthologies of compositions by the Alvars, the Nalayira Divyaprabandham, was frequently described as the Tamil Veda, thus claiming that the text was as significant as the four Vedas in Sanskrit that were cherished by the Brahmanas.




6.  Solution:  c)

The Acts of Parliament do not apply fully to these areas. Governor specifies to what extent these laws are applicable to the 6th schedule areas.

Laws made on matters like land, forests etc. (except on customary or religious matters) require the assent of the Governor.






7.  Solution: d)

The Parliament can make laws on any subject of the three lists (including the State List) for the union territories. This power of Parliament also extends to Puducherry and Delhi, which have their own local legislatures.

The Lt. governor is empowered to promulgate ordinances during recess of the assembly. An ordinance has the same force as an act of the assembly. Every such ordinance must be approved by the assembly within six weeks from its reassembly. He can also withdraw an ordinance at any time.

They are set up by the Prime Minister according to the exigencies of the time and requirements of the situation. Hence, their number, nomenclature, and composition varies from time to time.

Their membership varies from three to eight. They usually include only Cabinet Ministers. However, the non-cabinet Ministers are not debarred from their membership.



12.Solution: d)

The Vice-President holds office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office. However, he can resign from his office at any time by addressing the resignation letter to the President. He can also be removed from the office before completion of his term.

A formal impeachment is not required for his removal. He can be removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by an absolute majority (i.e., a majority of the total members of the House) and agreed to by the Lok Sabha. But, no such resolution can be moved unless at least 14 day’s advance notice has been given. Notably, no ground has been mentioned in the Constitution for his removal.

The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five years until his successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for re-election to that office. He may be elected for any number of terms.




13.Solution: a)

The Constitution of J&K was adopted on 17 November 1957, and came into force on 26 January
1957. Its salient features (as amended from time to time) are as follows:

•   It declares the State of J&K to be an integral part of India.
•   It secures justice, liberty, equality and fraternity to the people of the state.
•   It says that the State of J&K comprises all the territory that was under the ruler of the state on 15 August 1947. This means that the territory of the state also includes the area which is under the occupation of Pakistan.




14.Solution: c)

As per Bommai case (1994), secularism is one of the basic features of the Constitution. Hence, a state government pursuing anti-secular politics is liable to action under Article 356.

However, it would be improper to impose in cases of

•   Maladministration in the state or allegations of corruption against the ministry or stringent financial exigencies of the state.
•   Where the state government is not given prior warning to rectify itself except in case of
extreme urgency leading to disastrous consequences.

15. Solution: b)

The Zonal Councils are the statutory (and not the constitutional) bodies. They are established by an Act of the Parliament, that is, States Reorganisation Act of 1956.

The act divided the country into five zones (Northern, Central, Eastern, Western and Southern)
and provided a zonal council for each zone.

Each zonal council consists of the following members: (a) home minister of Central government. (b) chief ministers of all the States in the zone. (c) Two other ministers from each state in the zone. (d) Administrator of each union territory in the zone.




16.Solution: b)

Under the Constitution, the jurisdiction of each state is confined to its own territory. Hence, it is possible that the acts and records of one state may not be recognised in another state. To remove any such difficulty, the Constitution contains the “Full Faith and Credit” clause.

Full faith and credit is to be given throughout the territory of India to public acts, records and judicial proceedings of the Centre and every state. The expression ‘public acts’ includes both legislative and executive acts of the government. The expression ‘public record’ includes any official book, register or record made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duties.




17. Solution: a)

Ajivjkas have often been described as fatalists: those who believe that everything is predetermined.

The other school belonging to the tradition of the Lokayatas are usually described as materialists. They believe the world to be a play of elements which will all pass on the earth and space when one dies.

Texts from these traditions have not survived, so we know about them only from the works of other traditions.




18.Solution: c)

Asceticism and penance are required to free oneself from the cycle of karma.

This can be achieved only by renouncing the world; therefore, monastic existence is a necessary condition of salvation.

Jaina monks and nuns (women) took five vows: to abstain from killing, stealing and lying; to observe celibacy; and to abstain from possessing property.

19.Solution: b)

The khanqah was the centre of social life in Sufism.

We know about Shaikh Nizamuddin’s hospice (c. Fourteenth century) on the banks of the river
Yamuna in Ghiyaspur, on the outskirts of what was then the city of Delhi.

It comprised several small rooms and a big hall ( jama’at khana) where the inmates and visitors lived and prayed. The inmates included family members of the Shaikh, his attendants and disciples.

21.Solution: a)

People began transplanting paddy since ages. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields.

This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, this also required a large amount of labour and resources.

While Magadha became a powerful kingdom, places like Vajji, with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a different form of government, known as gana or sangha.

In a gana or a sangha there were not one, but many rulers. Sometimes, even when thousands of men ruled together, each one was known as a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through discussion and debate.

For example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they met to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies.

Both the Buddha and Mahavira belonged to ganas or sanghas.




23.           Solution: a)

The Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled).

Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things).

The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything.




24.           Solution: a)

The empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than
2300 years ago.

Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya’s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra.

The treatise contains details on administration, kingdom economy, politics, ethics and several other matters that are helpful in governing a kingdom.




25.           Solution: d)

He did not believe in idol worship and all the rituals propagated by the Brahmins.

He believed in the Vedic truth of one God. Salvation for him was to be attained while living in the world with right conduct.

He rejected that attaning Moksha or liberation was the aim of life.

In June 1920, Jawaharlal Nehru began going around the villages in Awadh, talking to the villagers, and trying to understand their grievances. By October, the Oudh Kisan Sabha was set up headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Baba Ramchandra and a few others.

Within a month, over 300 branches had been set up in the villages around the region. So when the Non- Cooperation Movement began the following year, the effort of the Congress was to integrate the Awadh peasant struggle into the wider struggle. The peasant movement, however, developed in forms that the Congress leadership was unhappy with. As the movement spread in 1921, the
houses of talukdars and merchants were attacked, bazaars were looted, and grain hoards were
taken over .




27.           Solution: b)

Not all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj. One such group was the nation’s ‘untouchables’, who from around the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. Congress had ignored the dalits for long, for fear of offending the sanatanis, the conservative high-caste Hindus.

Thus, they began organising themselves, demanding reserved seats in educational institutions, and a separate electorate that would choose dalit members for legislative councils. Political empowerment, they believed, would resolve the problems of their social disabilities.

Dalit participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was therefore limited, particularly in the
Maharashtra and Nagpur region where their organisation was quite strong.

In Kheda, Gujarat, the peasants were frequently plagued by poverty, famines, scant resource, untouchability, alcoholism and British discrimination. The famine of Chhappania Akal and some subsequent famines had destroyed the agrarian economy of the region and the peasants were still dying out of starvation.

Yet the authorities refused to grant remission of revenue. Gandhiji thus led the movement as the spiritual leader of the peasants, with Sardar Patel.

The mapping of the ocean floor and palaeomagnetic studies of rocks from oceanic regions revealed the following facts:

•   It was realised that all along the mid-oceanic ridges, volcanic eruptions are common and they bring huge amounts of lava to the surface in this area.
•   The rocks equidistant on either sides of the crest of mid-oceanic ridges show remarkable similarities in terms of period of formation, chemical compositions and magnetic
properties. Rocks closer to the mid-oceanic ridges are normal polarity and are the youngest.
The age of the rocks increases as one moves away from the crest.
•   The ocean crust rocks are much younger than the continental rocks.

Such fragments are transported by different exogenous agencies and deposited.

These deposits through compaction turn into rocks. This process is called lithification. In many sedimentary rocks, the layers of deposits retain their characteristics even after lithification.

Hence, we see a number of layers of varying thickness in sedimentary rocks like sandstone, shale etc.

Weathering mantles with different profiles have various mineral and chemical zones that give way to one another on the vertical, from the slightly altered bedrock to the intensively altered outcropping rocks, and that are characteristic of the particular mantle.

The formation of the weathering mantle depends on climate, the composition of the bedrock, hydrogeological conditions, the relief of the terrain, tectonic structure, the duration of development, the age during which development occurred, and degree of mobility of the earth’s crust.

The thickest weathering mantles form in periods of tectonic inactivity in regions with moist, warm climates. Decomposition of a large mass of organic matter leads to the formation of CO2 and organic acids that filter from the soil into the weathering mantle, decompose rocks at a deep level, and leach out the soluble products of weathering.




51. Solution: a)

When river enters a bend, the velocity of water is naturally higher at one end of the bank than the other end of the bank.

This difference causes erosion of bank at one side due to higher velocity. The other side being at lower velocity causes deposition of material.

The troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator.

This layer contains dust particles and water vapour.

All changes in climate and weather take place in this layer. The temperature in this layer decreases at the rate of 1°C for every 165m of height. This is the most important layer for all biological
activity.

The insolation received at the surface varies from about 320 Watt/m2 in the tropics to about 70
Watt/m2 in the poles.

Maximum insolation is received over the subtropical deserts, where the cloudiness is the least. Equator receives comparatively less insolation than the tropics.

Generally, at the same latitude the insolation is more over the continent than over the oceans. In winter, the middle and higher latitudes receive less radiation than in summer.



54.           Solution: d)

When the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as dew. The ideal conditions for its formation are clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and cold and long nights.

For the formation of dew, it is necessary that the dew point is above the freezing point.




55.           Solution: b)

Between the latitudes 35 and 40 N and S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west. But, between 45 and 65 N and S of equator, due to the westerlies, the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east.

The central parts of the tropical land and the eastern and interior parts of the temperate lands receive rainfall varying between 50 - 100 cm per annum. Here moisture also an important reason.




56.           Solution: c)

Mediterranean climate occurs around Mediterranean sea, along the west coast of continents in subtropical latitudes between 30° - 40° latitudes e.g. — Central California, Central Chile, along the coast in south eastern and south western Australia.

These areas come under the influence of sub tropical high in summer and westerly wind in winter. Hence, the climate is characterised by hot, dry summer and mild, rainy winter. Monthly average temperature in summer is around 25° C and in winter below 10°C. The annual precipitation ranges between 35 - 90 cm.

Factors affecting ocean salinity are mentioned below:

•   The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depends mainly on evaporation and precipitation.
•   Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by the fresh water flow from rivers, and in polar regions by the processes of freezing and thawing of ice.
•   Wind, also influences salinity of an area by transferring water to other areas.
•   The ocean currents contribute to the salinity variations. Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated.
•   Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the salinity of an area.




58.           Solution: d)

The vertical motion refers to the rise and fall of water in the oceans and seas. Due to attraction of the sun and the moon, the ocean water is raised up and falls down twice a day.

More saline water subsides down in the ocean and less dense water comes on the surface. It is a dynamic process.

The upwelling of cold water from subsurface and the sinking of surface water are also forms of vertical motion of ocean water.

61.Solution: d)

A study of rainfall patterns does not reveal the whole truth behind the water availability in various regions in India. Rains in India are largely due to the monsoons. This means that most of the rain falls in a few months of the year.

Despite nature’s monsoon bounty, failure to sustain water availability underground has resulted largely from the loss of vegetation cover, diversion for high water demanding crops, and pollution from industrial effluents and urban wastes. Irrigation methods like dams, tanks and canals have been used in various parts of India since ancient times.




62.           Solution: d)

The Chipko Andolan was the result of a grassroot level effort to end the alienation of people from their forests. The movement originated from an incident in a remote village called Reni in Garhwal, high-up in the Himalayas during the early 1970s.

There was a dispute between the local villagers and a logging contractor who had been allowed to fell trees in a forest close to the village.

Inherent in such a competition to control a natural resource is the conservation of a replenishable resource. Specifically the method of use was being called into question.

The Chipko movement quickly spread across communities and media, and forced the government, to whom the forest belongs, to rethink their priorities in the use of forest produce.

The Ganga Action Plan, a multi-crore project came about in 1985 because the quality of the water in the Ganga was very poor.

Coliform is a group of bacteria, found in human intestines, whose presence in water indicates contamination by disease-causing microorganisms.

The coliform level in Ganga increased so much that it indicated the water to be unsafe for humans.

The water at the surface of the sea or ocean is heated by the Sun while the water in deeper sections is relatively cold. This difference in temperature is exploited to obtain energy in ocean-thermal- energy conversion plants.

These plants can operate if the temperature difference between the water at the surface and water at depths up to 2 km is 293 K (20°C) or more. The warm surface-water is used to boil a volatile liquid like ammonia. The vapours of the liquid are then used to run the turbine of generator. The cold water from the depth of the ocean is pumped up and condense vapour again to liquid.

In a bio-gas plant, a slurry of cow-dung and water is made in the mixing tank from where it is fed into the digester. The digester is a sealed chamber in which there is no oxygen.

Anaerobic micro-organisms that do not require oxygen decompose or break down complex compounds of the cow-dung slurry. It takes a few days for the decomposition process to be
complete and generate gases like methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide.

67.           Solution: a)

Large amount of fossil fuels are burnt every day in power stations to heat up water to produce steam which further runs the turbine to generate electricity. The transmission of electricity is more efficient than transporting coal or petroleum over the same distance. Therefore, many thermal power plants are set up near coal or oil fields. The term thermal power plant is used since fuel is burnt to produce heat energy which is converted into electrical energy.

68.           Solution: a)

The difference between the direct and alternating currents is that the direct current always flows in one direction, whereas the alternating current reverses its direction periodically.

Most power stations constructed these days produce AC. In India, the AC changes direction after every 1/100 second, that is, the frequency of AC is 50 Hz. An important advantage of AC over DC is that electric power can be transmitted over long distances without much loss of energy.

70.           Solution: a)

The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about
1.8 times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine
particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red.

The scattered blue light enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.

A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower. It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun.

The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop. Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reach the observer’s eye.

When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.

This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light.

Animals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen from the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide produced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the atmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen dissolved in water.

Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.
Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.




74.           Solution: c)

Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while unsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of black smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on a metal plate. However, limiting the supply of air leads to incomplete combustion of even saturated
hydrocarbons thus giving a sooty flame.

The gas/kerosene stove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich mixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of cooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked and fuel is getting wasted.




75.Solution: c)

All living structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon dioxide.

Oxygen and silica are the most abundant on earth’s crust. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the importance of carbon seems to be immense.

Speculative demand is the demand for financial assets, such as securities, money, or foreign currency, that is not dictated by real transactions such as trade or financing.

Speculative demand arises from the need for cash to take advantage of investment opportunities that may arise.

In economic theory, specifically Keynesian economics, speculative demand is one of the determinants of demand for money (and credit), the others being transactions demand and precautionary demand.

Speculative demand refers to real balances held for the purpose of avoiding capital loss from holding bonds. The net return on bonds is the sum of the interest payments and the capital gains (or losses) from their varying market value. A rise in interest rate causes aftermarket bond prices to fall, and that implies a capital loss from holding bonds. Accordingly, the return on bonds can be negative. Thus, people may hold money to avoid the loss from bonds.

Disguised unemployment is unemployment that does not affect aggregate output. Disguised unemployment exists where part of the labour force is either left without work or is working in a redundant manner where worker productivity is essentially zero.

So addition of one more (marginal) worker will add noting to the productivity of the farm (which means the marginal productivity of the labour is zero). An economy demonstrates disguised unemployment where productivity is low and where too many workers are filling too few jobs.

It is a situation where bank cash-holdings are rising and banks cannot find sufficient number of qualified borrowers even at extraordinary low rates of interest.

It usually arises where people are not buying and firms are not borrowing (for inventory or plant and equipment) because economic prospects look dim, investors are not investing because
expected returns from investments are low, and/or a recession is beginning. People and businesses hold on to their cash and thus get trapped in a self-fulfilling prophecy. And everyone expects the interest rates to rise hoping the situation to become better.

Price rigging refers to manipulating the prices of securities with the main objective of inflating or depressing the market price of securities. SEBI prohibits such practice because this can defraud and cheat the investors.

On the other hand, Insider is any person connected with the company such as directors, promoters etc. These insiders have sensitive information which affects the prices of the securities. This information is not available to people at large but the insiders get this privileged information by working inside the company and if they use this information to make profit, then it is known as insider trading.

It also provides these services:

•   Managing the public debt and the issue of new loans and Treasury Bills of the Central
Government.
•   Providing ways and means advances to the Central and State Governments to bridge the interval between expenditure and flow of receipts of revenue. Such advances are to be repaid by the government within three months from the date of borrowal.
•   Advising the Central and State Governments on financial matters, such as the quantum, timing and terms of issue of new loans. For ensuring the success of government loan
operations, the RBI plays an active role in the gilt-edged market.

Monetary Fund and the World Bank.




90.           Solution: d)

In India, to check the rise in prices of food-grains, edible oils, sugar etc., the Government has often taken steps to increase imports of goods in short supply to enlarge their available supplies.

When inflation is of the type of supply-side inflation, imports are increased to augment the domestic supplies of goods. To increase imports of goods in short supply the Govern-ment reduces customs duties on them so that their imports become cheaper and help in containing inflation.

For example in 2008-09 the Indian Government removed customs duties on imports of wheat and rice and reduced them on oilseeds, steel etc. to increase their supplies in India.

It is a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies; it provides a mechanism to ensure prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time.

A transgene is a gene or genetic material that has been transferred naturally, or by any of a number of genetic engineering techniques from one organism to another. The introduction of a transgene has the potential to change the phenotype of an organism.

In its most precise usage, the term transgene describes a segment of DNA containing a gene sequence that has been isolated from one organism and is introduced into a different organism. This non-native segment of DNA may retain the ability to produce RNA or protein in the
transgenic organism, or it may alter the normal function of the transgenic organism's genetic code.

94.           Solution: d)

Biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. Biopesticides fall into three major classes:

•   Microbial pesticides consist of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient.
•   Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant.
•   Biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms. Conventional pesticides, by contrast, are generally synthetic materials that directly kill or inactivate the pest. Biochemical pesticides include substances, such as insect sex pheromones, that interfere with mating, as well as various scented plant extracts that attract insect pests to traps.

In biology, a subculture is a new cell or microbiological culture made by transferring some or all cells from a previous culture to fresh growth medium.

This action is called subculturing or passaging the cells.

Subculture is used to prolong the life and/or expand the number of cells or microorganisms in the culture.




96.           Solution: c)

Insects, mites, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, MLOs and other organisms are known to attack various crops of economic importance. These pests and pathogens not only reduce the quantity but also spoil the quality of the produce to a considerable extent. These may be carried with the plants that enter a national border.

Plant quarantine may, therefore, be defined as 'Rules and regulations promulgated by governments to regulate the introduction of plants, planting materials, plant products, soil, living organisms, etc. with a view to prevent inadvertent introduction of exotic pests, weeds and pathogens harmful to the agriculture or the environment of a country/region, and if introduced, to prevent their establishment and further spread'. Plant quarantine is thus designed as a safeguard against harmful pests/pathogens exotic to a country or a region.

98.           Solution: a)

The ozone layer is typically thicker over the poles than over the equator for three reasons. First, there is a lack of sunlight during an arctic winter to break it down.

Second, seasonal weather systems and wind patterns in the upper atmosphere push more ozone toward the poles in winter.

Third, the vertical structure of the atmosphere affects thickness. Near the equator, the troposphere makes up about 18 kilometres of the atmosphere. At the poles, it thins to only 8-kilometres thick. The boundary between the layers, called the tropopause, slopes downward from the equator to the poles like the bottom of a swimming pool. Over the Arctic, at the deepest part of the "pool", the thicker stratosphere can hold more ozone than over the Tropics or middle latitudes.

The atmosphere over the Arctic also holds more ozone than in the Antarctic, because stratospheric winds in the Southern Hemisphere are less effective at transporting ozone.




99.           Solution: d)

Several low lying islands like Maldives (tourism hub) may be submerged due to sea-level rise.

Seawater will inundate into fresh groundwater resources because of a higher sea water pressure due to higher levels.

Inundation of coastal marshes and estuaries may deprive several bird an fish species of their breeding grounds.




100.         Solution: d)

Nitrogen fertilizers help produce N2O which is a greenhouse gas.
Increasing forest cover will act as a carbon sink reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Urban heat islands preserve the day heat at night too and intensify the heat patterns caused by
global warming. Reducing them will lower the average temperature of cities.
