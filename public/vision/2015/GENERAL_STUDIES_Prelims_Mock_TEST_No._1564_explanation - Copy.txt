Q 1.A


Both travel at the same speed in a vacuum. Both are electromagne  c waves.

Q 2.B


Proton-beam therapy can avoid this type of collateral damage. Protons are posi  vely charged atomic par  cles, and they have tremendous energy but also tremendous mass. They're easier to control than X-rays. They slow down as they encounter body   ssue. Protons can actually be set to release their energy at a speciﬁc point in body.
unlike the present    mes, where radia  on generated by a machine bores through the body, aﬀec  ng also the healthy cells on the way, protons hit the aﬀected part and stay put. Also, in conven  onal therapy, the rays harm healthy   ssue on their way to a  acking the tumour. Compared  to  normal  X-ray  radia  on,  protons  are  about  60  per  cent  less  harmful  for  the body.Protons are energised to speciﬁc veloci  es determined by the oncologist as to how deeply in the human body they were expected to deposit their maximum energy.

Q 3.C Q 4.A Q 5.D





Because there is a layer of air between them.Â  Air is a great thermal isolator, even be  er than most clothing.Â
The air between the thin blankets is not moving around and will form an isola  ng layer that acts exactly like another blanket, thus improving the thermal isola  on.

Q 6.B Q 7.C



As anything is heated it also looses heat back to its surroundings by radia  on. The wavelength of that radiated energy is related to temperature. As temperature rises, the radia  on becomes of increasingly higher energy, higher energy radia  on means decreasing wavelength.
At low temperatures, the radia  on is IR - infra-red, which we cannot see. As temperature rises, the radia  on becomes red, then orange light. Keep hea  ng and eventually the light will become white as light of increasingly higher energy (shorter wavelegth) is emi  ed.

Q 8.C


When light travels from an op  cally denser medium to a rarer medium at the interface, it is partly reﬂected back into the same medium and partly refracted to the second medium. If the angle of incidence is greater than the cri  cial angle refrac  on is not possible, and the incident ray is totally reﬂected. This is called total internal reﬂec  on.
Op  cal ﬁbres are thin hair like strands made up of glass or ﬁbre which are used transmit data in the form of light signals and work on the pricipal of total internal reﬂecon. When a signal in the form of light is directed at one end of the ﬁbre at a suitable angle, it undergoes repeated total internal reﬂecons along the length of the ﬁbre and ﬁnally comes out at the other end. Thus op  on 1 is correct.
Simple op  cal microscope uses convex lens or group of lens to magnify the object which works
on the principle of refrac  on and does not use the priciple of total internal reﬂecon. Thus op  on 2 is wrong.

On hot summer days, the air near the ground becomes ho  er than the air at higher levels. The
refrac  ve  index  of  air  increases  with  its  density.  Ho  er  air  is  less  dense,  and  has  smaller refrac  ve index than the cooler air. If the air currents are small, that is, the air is s  ll, the op  cal density at diﬀerent layers of air increases with height. As a result, light from a tall object such as a tree, passes through a medium whose refrac  ve index decreases towards the ground. Thus, a ray of light from such an object successively bends away from the normal and undergoes total internal reﬂecon, if the angle of incidence for the air near the ground exceeds the cri  cal angle. To a distant observer, the light appears to be coming from somewhere below the ground. The observer naturally assumes that light is being reﬂected from the ground, say, by a pool of water near the tall object. Such inverted images of distant tall objects cause an op  cal illusion to the observer. This phenomenon is called mirage. This type of mirage is especially common in hot deserts. Thus on a hot summer day, a distant patch of road, especially on a highway, appears to be wet. Thus op  on 3 is correct.
A pencil immersed in water looks bent due to the phenonmenon of refrac  on. Thus op  on 4 is wrong.

Q 9.C


About every 11 years the magne  c ﬁeld on the sun reverses completely â€“ the north magne  c pole switches to south, and vice versa. This ﬂip coincides with the greatest solar ac  vity seen on the sun in any given cycle, known as "solar maximum."
Solar maximum or solar max is a normal period of greatest solar ac  vity in the 11 year solar cycle of the Sun. During solar maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun's irradiance output grows by about 0.1%.
The  sunâ€™s  magne  c  ﬁeld,  dubbed  its  â€œheartbeat,â€  evolves  in  a  cycle,  the  most prominent of which is the reversal of its polari  es which takes places every eleven years, which coincides with the sunspot appearances.
Recent simula  ons have ushered in a major understanding of aspects of the sunâ€™s magne  c ﬁeld.
The interes  ng part of the ﬁndings of the simula  on are these: at the base of the sunâ€™s turbulent convec  on layer, torus-like bands of magne  c ﬁeld of opposite polari  es forms at mid-la  tude on either hemisphere. Intriguingly, the torus-like bands of magne  c ﬁeld undergo polarity reversals once every forty years.

Q 10.C Q 11.C
They are nearer to earth and hence we receive a greater amount of light and, therefore minor varia  ons in the intensity are not no  ceable.







Q 12.C

WHY IS THE SUNSET RED?


As the sun begins to set, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reﬂected and sca  ered. As less reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, ﬁrst to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now sca  ered. Only the longer wavelengths are

Q 13.A
In electrolysis there is a posi  ve node and nega  ve node which remain so throughout the process. If AC current is  used then the polariza  on will change a  er each cycle hence no electrolysis will occur and it will be same as passing no current.
In a cell there is one posi  ve and another nega  ve node. It is between these two nodes that the current ﬂows. Since, the polarity of the node cannot change; the current will always be DC. Electromagnets can only be prepared using DC current. If AC current is used the polarity of magnet will keep changing a  er each cycle and hence it will not be magne  zed.

Q 14.C
When the bird perches on a live wire, her body becomes charged--for the moment, it's at the same voltage as the wire. But no current ﬂows into her body. A body is a poor conductor compared to copper wire, so there's no reason for electrons to take a detour through the bird. More importantly, electrons current ﬂow from a region of high voltage to one of low voltage. The dri  ing current, in eﬀect, ignores the bird.
But if a bird (or a power line worker) accidentally touches an electrical "ground" while in contact with the high-voltage wire, she completes an electrical circuit. A ground is a region of approximately zero voltage. The earth, and anything touching it that can conduct current, is the ground.









Q 15.D

The Commi  ee iden  ﬁed the following six technologies-

1.  Physical  separa  on  including  ﬁltra  on,  ultra  ﬁltra  on  and  membrane  ﬁltra  on,  adsorp  on, absorp  on.

2. Ion exchange

3. Reverse osmosis

4. Ultra Violet Radi  on

5. Hybrid of Mul  ple Methods

6. Miscellaneous
Reverse Osmosis:

Diﬀusion is the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentra  on to a region of lower concentra  on.  Osmosis  is  a  special  case  of  diﬀusion  in  which  the  molecules  are  water  and  the concentra  on gradient occurs across a semipermeable membrane. The semipermeable membrane allows the passage of water, but not ions (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Cl-) or larger molecules (e.g., glucose, urea, bacteria). Diﬀusion and osmosis are thermodynamically favorable and will con  nue un  l equilibrium is reached. Osmosis can be slowed, stopped, or even reversed if suﬃcient pressure is applied to the membrane from the 'concentrated' side of the membrane.



Q 16.D Q 17.C
When  cool  air  ﬂows  from  a  high  mountain  region  to  a  region  of  lower  eleva  on,  the  air undergoes adiaba  c warming. Adiaba  c warming occurs as the pressure of the air is increased as it descends.

Q 18.A

No force is needed because there is no resis  ve force trying to slow the earth down, so in a sense it rotates now because it rotated before: angular momentum. To a good approxima  on, the planets and sun exert zero rota  onal (as opposed to linear gravita  onal) forces on each other. However, there are subtle couplings related to deforma  ons of the planets, which is why for example the moon rotates so that one hemisphere is always visible from earth. By a similar mechanism the earth's rate of rota  on could also change.



Q 19.A Q 20.D
If a point soure of light is kept at the focus of the concave mirror, the reﬂec  ng rays tend to be parallel to each other. Similar concept is used in theatres,where the point source of sound is kept in such a way that the cieling behaves like a concave mirror and the reﬂected waves are parallel to each other.Thus, avoiding reﬂected ways to interfere with each other.

Q 21.C Q 22.B
The device used to test whether an object has charge or not is called electroscope.
Charge can neither be created nor destroyed like energy. The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the earth is called earthing. Earthing is provided in buildings to protect us from electrical shocks due to any leakage of electrical current.
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rubbing will strip the atoms of the rod of their electrons, which are nega  vely charged, leaving the rod to be posively charged. The silk will acquire these extra electrons, becoming nega  vely charged. why is it that the electrons move from the glass to the silk and not the other way? This is because the material silk is made from allows it to gain electrons easier, much easier than glass.

Q 23.B
The atomic energy programme in India was launched around the   me of independence under
the leadership of Homi J. Bhabha.
The main objec  ves of the Indian Atomic Energy programme are to provide safe and reliable electric power for the countryâ€™s social and economic progress and to be self-reliant in all
aspects of nuclear technology.

India has adopted a three-stage strategy of nuclear power genera  on.
The ﬁrst stage involves the use of natural uranium as a fuel, with heavy water as moderator. Indiaâ€™s second stage of nuclear power genera  on envisages the use of Pu-239 obtained from the ﬁrst stage reactor opera  on, as the fuel core in fast breeder reactors (FBR).
The third phase of Indiaâ€™s Nuclear Power Genera  on programme is, breeder reactors using
U-233 fuel.
The  third  stage  involves  using  fast  breeder  reactors  to  produce  ﬁssile  Uranium-233  from
Thorium-232.
Kalpakkam has the unique dis  nc  on of being the only place in the world, where all the three ﬁssile isotopes viz., U-235, Pu-239 & U-233 are used as fuel in reactors.

Q 25.D
The force applied by archer while stretching the bow is a muscular force.But a  er the arrow has le   the bow only gravity and fric  on of air are ac  ng on it.

Q 26.A

Very  ﬁne  par  cles  sca  er  mainly  blue  light  while  par  cles  of  larger  size  sca  er  light  of  longer wavelengths. The molecules of air and other ﬁne par  cles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength  of visible light. These are more eﬀec  ve in sca  ering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than the light of longer wavelengths at the red end. This is the reason the danger signal lights are red in color.



Q 27.D Q 28.D
Electric water heater works on the principle of Jouleâ€™s hea  ng. It heats water when current passes through it.
CFL bulb do not make use of heat generated by the electricity. The light is emi  ed by the excited gas par  cles in CFL bulb, not through the hea  ng of conduc  ng material
Incandescent bulb  make  use  of  Jouleâ€™s hea  ng. When electricity  is  passed  through the tungsten ﬁlament, it will be heated to a high temperature and subsequently it emits light. Electric fuse also works on Jouleâ€™s hea  ng eﬀect principle. Whenever I high electric current passes through it, it will get heated and melts stopping the ﬂow of high electric current.









Q 29.D Q 30.C

Current through the circuit and the voltage applied to the toaster.
Q 31.D Q 32.B Q 33.D

WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?


The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh sca  ering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Li  le of the red, orange and yellow light is aﬀected by the air.

However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in diﬀerent direc  ons. It gets sca  ered all around the sky. Whichever direc  on you look, some of this sca  ered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.















As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the sca  ered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets sca  ered away again in other direc  ons. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white.






Q 34.A
When sound wave moves from one medium to another, the wave is refracted. It is because of diﬀerent speed of sound in diﬀerent mediums.
Since, the temperature near the surface of the air is maximum above the ground and it diminishes upwards. Thus, speed of sound is largest near the surface of the earth and decreases upwards. So a sound wave diverges upwards from a source on or near the surface of earth and is refracted con  nuously towards the normal and hence less sound reaches the observer.
At the dusk situa  on is opposite. A wave diverging upwards form a source on or near the surface is refracted con  nuously away from normal. Now, it is totally reﬂected and it begins to travel downwards with con  nuous refrac  on to reach the observer.

Q 35.D
Sound waves have spherical wave-fronts. However, when they are away from the source, they almost  become  plane and the shape of wave-front  changes when  it meets an  obstacle or opening in its path. This leads to bending of the wave around the edges. Such, bending of waves is  called  as  diﬀrac  on.  The  eﬀect  of  diﬀrac  on  is  prominent  when  the  dimensions  of  the obstacle are of the order of the wavelength of the wave. Since, the wavelength of the sound wave is nearly one meter, it gets diﬀracted or bends at the doors and windows and we are able to hear the voices of people in the room beside us.

Q 36.B
Physical  contact  is  not  essen  al  for  cooking  here  as  waves  who  can  travel  in  the  air  are responsible for cooking the food

Q 37.D Q 38.C
because the pressure level is higher down so far, therefore the less pressure surrounding the bubbles as they rise means the gas making up the bubble isn't as compressed meaning the area that the gas ﬁlls is greater... thus making the bubble bigger

Q 39.B
Since, moon does not have any atmosphere, it implies that there will be no buoyant force. Hence,  for  two  freely  falling  bodies  irrespec  ve  of  their  masses,  they  will  have  same accelera  on due to gravity and same ﬁnal velocity a  er a   me t (v=u+gt). They will also cover same distance (S= ut+1/2at*t).
However, they will experience diﬀerent forces as F=Mg and masses are diﬀerent.
Similarly, a  er    me t, they are at the same height above the surface of moon. But, due to diﬀerent masses they will have diﬀerent poten  al energies.
If thrown with same velocity from surface it wA  ain same height above the moonâ€™s surface.


Q 40.B Q 41.D

The circuits in our homes are parallel circuits with each equipment having a diﬀerent resistance according to its need of the current.



Q 42.B
For the solids whose volume decreases on mel  ng into liquid form, an increase in pressure will lower down the mel  ng point. While for the solids whose volume increases on mel  ng into liquid, an increase in pressure will increase their mel  ng point. Hence, ice melts at temperature lower than zero degree Celsius.
When  light  hits  an  object  some  wavelengths  are  absorbed  by  that  object  and  some  are reﬂected. Light of diﬀerent wavelengths looks like diﬀerent colors to us. When we see an object of a certain color that means that light of that color's wavelength is being reﬂected oﬀ the object. For example, when you see a red shirt, the shirt is absorbing all the colors of light except for the red color. The frequency of light that we see as red is being reﬂected and we see that shirt as red.

Q 45.C

With available technologies, it is not possible to reach out of atmosphere with horizontal launch. At

Q 46.A
In an induc  on stove cooking occurs due to heat energy produced by the resistance provided by vessel to the eddy currents generated in the vessel.
Most uniform hea  ng is provided by Microwave Oven. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Copper vessel is not used because it is not ferromagne  c & hence no eddy current is produced due to induc  on. It being a good conductor has no role to play. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.

Q 47.B
To analyze this properly, it is best to consider the cart and the horse separately. The forces on the cart include the forward force the horse exerts on the cart and the backward force due to fric  on at the ground, ac  ng on the wheels. At rest, or at constant velocity, these two are equal in size, because the accelera  on of the cart is zero.
The forces on the horse include the backward force the cart exerts on the horse and the forward force of the ground on its hooves. At rest, or at constant velocity, these two are equal in size, because the accelera  on of the horse is zero.
The force the horse exerts on the cart is of equal size and opposite direc  on to the force the cart exerts on the horse, by Newton's third law.
When the horse and the cart move then forward force is greater than the reac  on force and for the cart, the pull force y horse is greater than fric  onal force.

Q 48.C

There are two types of waves- longitudinal and transverse (light).



Q 49.C
LCD has be  er color satura  on than DLP.
LCD could be hung on the wall because of itâ€™s 4â€³ depth, and less than 50â€³ length, when compared to DLPâ€™s 6â€³ to 18â€³ depth.
LCD has a bigger viewing angle, which is up to 60%, when compared to DLPâ€™s 40% viewing angles.
DLP has a longer lifespan of 80,000 to 100,000 hours, or around 30 years of regular viewing, while LCD has 70,000 to 80,000 hours, or around 28 years of regular viewing, before the color fades.
DLP is cheaper and of a higher quality than a LCD of the same size.
DLP has no screen door eﬀect, but it has a rainbow eﬀect
DLP is a low heat display, and low energy consump  on set.

The meteors are heavenly bodies which occasionally enter the atmosphere and if they reach the earth surface, they are called meteorites.

Q 53.D Q 54.D Q 55.A
The refrac  ve index of the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding, so that total internal reﬂecon occurs.
Light is propagated down an op  cal ﬁber by refrac  on and total internal reﬂecon. There is no dispersion in opcal ﬁber. Hence statement 2 is incorrect.
They do not produce sparks since they do not carry current.

Q 56.C
While it is stressful to watch TV in darkness owing to the constant relaxa  on and contrac  on of the iris and hence recommended not to watch TV in darkness, the same does not apply to watching a movie in a dark theatre.
The simple reason is that movie, unlike the TV or computer image is not in the form of pixels. Movie is in the form of analogue.
in the case of movies, the stress caused to the eyes is less as the eyes' ﬁeld of view is completely occupied by the screen.
This is not the case with TV or computer. The screen is smaller and does not ﬁll the complete ﬁeld of vision of the eyes.
Moreover, the object on the TV is constantly ﬂickering and we see areas that are of diﬀerent light intensies.








Q 57.D





Q 58.D

Mach number is the ra  o of the speed of the object to the speed of sound. A mach number of less than 1 means a speed less than the speed of sound and is called subsonic. Similarly a mach number of greater than 1 is supersonic speed and a mach number of more than 5 is called hypersonic speed. The speed of sound and light in any medium increases with increasing temperature.



Q 59.A
Q 60.C
There are a number of factors which aﬀect the shape of a liquid carrying tank. Most important one  is  the  stability  of  the  vehicle  on  the  move  while  taking  a  turn  on  the  road.  To  have maximum safety factor, the centre of gravity of the loaded vehicle has to be as close as possible to the ground.
This is achieved by adop  ng an ellip  cal shape of cross sec  on of the tank.  In fact the height of the centre of gravity will be least for a rectangular cross secon.
But then there are other problems with a rectangular sec  on like presence of corners (leading to cleaning problems), large number of joints and larger area of metal sheet for the same volume of the tank.
An ellip  cal sec  on also provides maximum stability against liquid movement inside the tank on account of lateral accelera  on.
Then the ques  on is why there are some tanks which have circular sec  on. In fact for vessels which contain pressurized liquids or gases like LPG or PNG, the circular sec  on is the most eﬃcient sec  on which gives maximum strength against internal pressure.
In such cases the strength of the tank may be the governing factor to decide the shape of the tank. That is why we ﬁnd circular sec  on tanks for carrying LPG or similar contents.

Q 61.C
Conductors, semiconductors and insulators are classiﬁed on the basis on conduc  vity/resis  vity.
Conductors possess very low resis  vity (or high conduc  vity).
Semiconductors   have   resis  vity   or   conduc  vity   intermediate   to   conductors   and insulators.
Insulators have high resis  vity (or low conduc  vity).

Thus  resis  vity  of  semiconductors  is  more  than  conductors  but  less  than  insulators.  Thus statement 1 is wrong.

Semiconductors can be :
Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge
Compound semiconductors: Examples are: Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.
Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.
Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.

Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on elemental semiconductors
Si or Ge and compound inorganic semiconductors. Thus statement 2 is correct.

Diode and Transistor are semiconductor devices but Capacitor is not a semiconductor device.
Thus op  on 3 is wrong.

Q 62.D Q 63.D
The black hole itself isn't emi   ng x-rays. The x-rays are emi  ed by gas falling into the black hole that's been accelerated as it gets close to the immense gravity, and is superheated as a result - it emits very hot radia  on, x-rays. The x-rays that are emi  ed before the gas passes the event horizon of the black hole are not trapped by the gravita  onal pull and we can detect them.
There is a way that black hole can loose mass and that is through HAWKING radia  on, even
though pre  y less but s  ll a ﬁnite amount
Hence only 1, 4 are correct.

h  ps://visionias.in/admin/index.php/admin/print_test_pt/15
Force while standing as well as lying is equal to the weight of the person. However, it is the greater pressure while standing that leads to person sinking to greater depth than when he is lying.

Q 65.C
There  are  various  reasons  of  following  this  prac  ce.  Centre  of  gravity  of  the  plane  lies somewhere in the middle of the fuselage which is close to the rear wheels. It is therefore desirable to bring the rear wheels to the ground ﬁrst for be  er controllability of the plane immediately a  er the touch down. Otherwise, if the plane lands on nose wheels, it would have a tendency to wobble and swing around wildly.
The second reason is that the nose wheels/ gears are not that strong so as to absorb the landing impact. Another reason and very important reason is that as soon as the rear wheels
Touch the runway, a resis  ve force distributed on both sides equally starts working on the plane. Because of two wheels located apart at adequate distance, it is much easier to control skidding/ going oﬀ the runway of the plane just in case there are unequal forces on two sides.

Q 66.D
A quantum computer is a computa  on device that makes direct use of quantum mechanical phenomena,  such  as  superposi  on  and  entanglement,   to  perform  opera  ons  on  data. Quantum computers are diﬀerent from digital computers based on transistors.

Q 70.C
The principal advantages associated with solar cells are that they have no moving parts, require li  le maintenance and work quite sa  sfactorily without the use of any focussing device. Another advantage is that they can be set up in remote and inaccessible hamlets or very sparsely inhabited areas in which laying of a power transmission line may be expensive and not commercially viable.Silicon, which is used for making solar cells, is abundant in nature but availability of the special grade silicon for making solar  cells  is  limited.  The  en  re  process  of  manufacture  is  s  ll  very  expensive,  silver  used  for interconnec  on of the cells in the panel further adds to the cost. In spite of the high cost and low eﬃciency, solar cells are used for many scien  ﬁc and technological applica  ons.

The Pressure exerted by the liquid does not depend upon the horizontal mo  on but only on the depth.
As height,h increases the pressure increases. P=hxdxg
where d= density and g=gravity

Q 87.D
Weight = Mg
Where, g=G * Mass of earth / Re * Re
Where G is Universal constant of gravita  on, Re is the radius of the earth
Since, earth is spheroid and not a perfect sphere; Re at poles is slightly less than that at the equator. As a result, g at poles > g at equator; hence weight decreases from poles to equator. Apparent accelera  on due to gravity, gâ€™=g-square of angular speed*Re* square of cos of A, where A is the angle between the equatorial plane and the posi  on of the object.
At poles A=90, hence, gâ€™=g
At poles A=0, hence, gâ€™=g-square of angular speed*Re. therefore, if earth stops rota  ng, the angular speed will become zero and a person standing at equator will have greater weight while the person at the pole will not be aﬀected.
If the speed of rota  on of earth is increased, then it is evident from the equa  on above that the weight of the person at the equator will decrease.

Q 88.C
The quality or   mber of sound is that characteris  c which enables us to dis  nguish one sound from another having the same pitch and loudness. The sound which is more pleasant is said to be of a rich quality.
The loudness or so  ness of a sound is determined basically by its amplitude. The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a so   sound because we produce a sound wave of less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table hard we hear a loud sound.  Loud sound can travel a larger distance as it is associated with higher energy. A sound wave spreads out from its source. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases.

Q 89.B
The sensa  on of sound persists in our ear for 0.1 second and this is the reason that an echo is possible only when the   me interval between the original and reﬂected sound is more than 0.1 second.









Q 90.C
It is a common misconcep  on that sound has the same speed in all media. Solids have the highest speed of sound in them. Gases generally have a smaller speed of sound than the liquids but there are excep  ons like the speed of sound in methanol is less than the speed of sound in
hydrogen.

Q 91.B Q 92.B
The fuse wire has a low mel  ng point so that as soon as there is a high current, the wire melts and the circuit is broken. This saves the other appliances from damage.

Q 93.C
Light bends or gets refracted due to the change in speed as it enters other medium. The speed of the light in a medium is inversely propor  onal to the density of the medium.

Q 94.D
VIBGYOR is the order of increasing wavelength and decreasing frequency. Infra red has higher wavelength than red and is invisible to us

Q 95.A
MRI scanning does not use X rays. X ray scanning uses ionising radia  ons to excite electrons in the atoms. MRI does not use ionising radia  ons. Instead, while in the magnet, radio waves redirect alignment of hydrogen atoms that naturally exist within the body without causing any chemical changes in the   ssues. As the hydrogen atoms return to their usual alignment, they emit energy that varies according to the type of body   ssue in which they lie. The MR scanner listens for this energy and creates a picture of the   ssues scanned.
MRI can be used to produce pictures of internal organs and so      ssues including bone. But it is more useful in so       ssue vlua  on. Computerised Tomography (CT scan) is suited for bone imaging, lung and chest imaging, cancer detec  on.
Jewellery  and other wearable metallic accessories are not allowed during MRI since it will interfere with the magne  c ﬁeld.

Q 96.D A force:
may make an object move from rest.
may change the speed of an objec  f it is moving. may change the direc  on of mo  onof an object. may bring about a change in theshape of an object. may cause some or all of theseeﬀects.

Q 97.C
Sodium vapour lamps produce yellow light which is more visible in the fog and rain compared to white light.
In fog air acts like prism and white light splits in component colours.

Q 100.A
Gamma rays are the most energe  c known form of electromagne  c radia  on, with frequencies of  3*1019  Hz  (30  EHz)  or  higher.  They  are  produced  from  the  decay  of  excited  nuclei  of radioac  ve elements. Gamma rays can penetrate through several cen  meters of lead and large doses of them are harmful.
X-rays have frequencies ranging from 3*1016 to 3*1019 Hz (30 PHz to 30 EHz). X-rays penetrate easily through some materials such as fat and muscle but not others such as bone, which makes them useful in medicine.
UV light has frequencies ranging from 8*1014  to 3*1016  Hz (800 THz to 30 PHz). Prolonged exposure to UV light causes sunburn and can cause skin cancer. The earth's ozone layer absorbs most of the incoming UV light from the sun.
