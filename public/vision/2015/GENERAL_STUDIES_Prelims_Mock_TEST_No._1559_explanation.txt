ANSWERS & EXPLANATION  GENERAL STUIDES (P) 2015 – Test 10 (1559)



Q 1.C
o  To address inflation RBI reduces the money supply in the economy. This can be done by increasing rather than decreasing  the rate at which RBI gives loan to commercial  banks which is called Bank Rate.
o  Reverse  Repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows from banks. If it is low then banks will lend less to RBI & their lending capacity to public will increase.
o  Increase in Statutory  Liquid Ratio forces the banks to keep a part of their deposits with themselves as liquid assets & increase in Cash Reserve  Ratio forces the banks to keep a part of their deposits with RBI. Hence, reducing their lending capacity. Addressing the supply side constraints by reducing middlemen is also an option but it is not exercised by RBI.

Q 2.A
o  Government has set up a panel under Professor B N Goldar to devise new Producer Price Index to replace Wholesale Price Index.
o  The proposed index will seek to bring India's inflation gauge on a par with international standards,
with PPI tracking changes at the producer level for both goods and services and CPI providing details of retail prices.
o  WPI includes taxes while PPI tracks inflation minus tax component.
o  While the present WPI does not considers services, PPI includes services.

Q 3.C
o  National  Food Security Act 2013, is an act to provide for food and nutritional security in human life cycle approach, by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Q 4.B
o  The Monetary  Policy Framework  agreement  was signed between  Central  government  and RBI as recommended by FSLRC.
o  The agreement places responsibility  on RBI to publish a document every six months giving sources
of inflation and forecast of inflation for next six months.
o  When the dispute about agreement arises it will be decided by GOI and RBI jointly in a meeting.
o  Rules of agreement mandate RBI to publish information regarding operation strategies.

1                                                                    www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
Q 5.D


Following things are included in External debt:
o  External Assistance
o  Short term Trade Credit
o  NRI deposits
o  Commercial Borrowings
o  Hence, 1st Statement is correct.
o  Presently more than 90% of government debt is from domestic market i.e. Internal Debt 92.9% of total debt at the end of March 2013, while the remaining constitutes external debt.Hence, 2nd Statement  is correct.
o  Repayment of External Commercial  Borrowing  (ECB) can be more than domestic borrowing even if interest rate on ECB is less than domestic interest rate as repayment will depend on exchange rate. If rate of rupee decreases with respect of foreign currency then the loans become costlier. Hence,
3rd Statement is correct.

Q 6.C
o  A statement  that summarizes  an economy's  transactions with the rest of the world for a specified time  period  is  BoP.  The balance  of payments  encompasses  all transactions  between  a country's residents  and  its  non-residents  involving  goods,  services  and  income;  financial  claims  on  and liabilities to the rest of the world; and transfers such as gifts.
o  The Balance  of Payments  (BoP) is a statistical  statement  that summarises  economic  transactions between residents and non-residents during a specific time period.
o  The concept of 'residence'    is central to BoP compilaon as it is a stas  cal statement showing all economic transactions between residents of one economy and those of the rest of the world (non- residents).
o  In compiling BoP, it is, therefore, necessary to determine the economic entities which are residents of an economy and those which are non-residents.

Q 7.C
o  5th plan was anti poverty plan.
o  6th was termed as Infrastructure - plan  because it shifted focus from  heavy industry to
infrastructure.

Q 8.C
o  Insider trading is defined as a malpractice  wherein trade of a company's  securities  is undertaken by people who by virtue of their work have access to the otherwise  non public information.
o  SEBI  in Jan. 2015   has tightened  the rules  by widening  the definition  of an insider  to cover  any person  who is a "connected  person"  or in possession  of or having  access  to Unpublished   Price- Sensitive  Information (UPSI). The regulator has defined "connected person" as any person who is in frequent  communication  with  the officers  of a company  or by being  in contractual,  fiduciary  or employment relationship with the company among other things.
o  Now, the onus of establishing that the connected person was not in possession of UPSI would be on him. But, if the person who has been alleged with insider trading violations is not connected to the company, then the onus of proving the same would be on the SEBI.
o  Under the new rules, mere  communication  of UPSI would  be punishable.  Earlier,  the regulator's stand was that mere communication without any trade would not be proceeded against.
o  Insiders are allowed to communicate  information  only for legitimate expectations,  performance  of duties and discharge  of legal obligations.  The SEBI has also given an exemption  for companies  to provide UPSI for the purpose of conducting due diligence.

Q 9.A

2                                                                    www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
(ii)  preservation of coastal ecology; and
(iii) promotion of economic activity that have necessarily to be located in the coastal regions.
In addition,  for the very first time an Island  Protection  Zone  Notification, 2011 was notified and published covering Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep.
The main objectives  of the SEZ Act are:
(a)  generation of additional economic activity; (b)  promotion of exports of goods and services;

o  Under Swavalamban Scheme- External website that opens in a new window, the government will contribute a sum of Rs.1,000 to each eligible NPS subscriber who contributes a minimum of Rs.1,000 and maximum Rs.12,000 per annum. It has now been made part of "PM Jan Dhan Yojana'.
o  Hence, only statement 3 is correct.

Q 13.C
o  RBI issues currency notes and coins except rupee 1 currency note and coin. Rupee 1 currency note is issued by Ministry of finance itself. So statement 1 is incorrect.
o  RBI does open market operations which means that RBI carries out sale and purchase of treasury bills of government. So statement 2 is correct.
o  RBI Manages the Foreign Exchange management  Act, 1999 which facilitate external trade and payment, and promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. So statement 3 is correct.

Q 14.C
o  The principal and the interest are also paid in foreign currency.

Q 15.C
o  A capital good is a durable good & one that does not quickly wear out & is used in the production of goods or services. It is the final good that is to be used as it is. Engine of a car is an intermediate good though durable it is not a final good to be used as it is. Similarly steel sheets are intermediate goods. Computer & Trucks used by business are final goods that are used for production of other goods & services.
o  Hence, answer is option c.

Q 16.D
o  The Currency  Deposit  Ratio (CDR) is the ratio of money held by the public in currency to that they hold  in  bank  deposits. cdr  =  CU/DD.  If  a  person  gets  Re  1  she  will  put  Rs  1/(1  +  CDR)  in  her bank account and keep Rs cdr/(1 + CDR) in cash. It reflects people's preference  for liquidity. It is a
3                                                                    www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
purely  behavioural  parameter  which  depends,  among  other things,  on  the  seasonal  pattern  of expenditure.
o  For example,  CDR increases during the festive  season as people convert  deposits  to cash balance for meeting extra expenditure during such periods.

Q 17.A
o  Initially, NPS was introduced for the new government recruits (except armed forces). With effect from 1stMay, 2009, NPS has been provided for all citizens of the country including the unorganised sector workers on voluntary basis. So statement 1 is correct.
o  Swavalamban is a social security scheme to popularize voluntary long-term retirement saving among low-income earners in the unorganised  sector. So statement 2 is incorrect.
o  The AABY extends life and disability cover to persons between the ages of 18 and 59 years, living below and marginally above the poverty line in 47 vocational/ occupational groups, including rural landless households. So statement 3 is incorrect.

Q 18.C
o  Currency devaluation depends upon the elasticity of demand for exports and imports and country specific but as J-curve effect suggests that initially the demand will remain inelastic and in the long- term, trade will become price elastic and imports will reduce, leading to reduction in CAD. So statement 1 is correct.
o  Reduction in import duties will increase current account deficit. So option 2 is incorrect. eg. increase in import duties of gold in 2014.
o  If an economy pursues a tightening of fiscal and monetary policy, this will reduce aggregate demand. Tight monetary policy involves increasing interest rates this will leave people with less money to spend so they will reduce their consumption of imports. So statement 3 is correct.
o  Export Subsidies will make export cheaper which will increase exports which in turn will reduce CAD.
So statement 4 is also correct.

Q 19.D
o  Statement   1:  A  rise  in  the  interest  rates  at  home  often  leads  to  an  appreciation  of  domestic currency but not always. Also, there can be restrictions in buying bonds issued by the governments. Rise  in  interest  rates  means  decrease  in  money  supply.  But  we  can't  say  that  the  demand  for domestic currency will increase with respect to other currencies.
o  Statement  2: According  to the Purchasing  Power Parity (PPP) theory, statement  can be accepted but some countries  erect tariff barriers. Also, there are many goods which are not tradeable  and inflation does not matter for them.

Q 20.B
o  GDP Deflator takes into account both the goods & services while WPI takes into account only the goods.
o  GDP deflator takes into account only the goods produced within country while WPI also includes imported goods as well. Hence, option b is correct answer.

Q 21.D
o  Consumer goods are those goods that are finally used by end consumer. However, it is not necessary that they are consumed in a short while. For example, consumer durable goods like a refrigerator may last longer than a capital good computer.
o  Value of consumer goods is counted in the calculation of GDP from which the national income is derived.
o  Sugar can be both a consumer as well as intermediate good. Sugar sold in supermarket is a consumer good while sugar being used to make a toffee is an intermediate good. Hence, all the statements are incorrect.

Q 22.B
o  FIPB only considers FDI proposals under Government approval route, and not through automatic route.
o  (March 2015) The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) has floated a draft cabinet note on the proposal to raise the threshold to Rs 3,000 crore from the current limit of Rs 1,200 crore.

Q 23.A
o  Round Tripping refers to money from one country going out through unofficial channels and being invested back into the same country from outside to avail of tax benefits under the double tax avoidance agreement  (DTAA).
o  Thus, it is a practice whereby a company deliberately incorporates a business unit in a tax haven to reinvest in the parent country to avoid paying taxes in the parent country.

Q 24.C

PI = National Income – UP – Corporate tax + Transfer payment to household (like pension etc.) – Net
Interest payment.

Q 25.D
o  RBI has recently announced guidelines for licensing of Payments Banks. Payments banks fall into the category of 'niche' or differentiated banks, meaning that they serve a specific purpose or a specific category of customers.
o  Payments Banks are targeted to serve low-income  households,  small businesses  and other unorganized  entities thus bringing hitherto those sections of populations into the banking fold which were earlier excluded.
o  The idea behind this is to facilitate  high volume and low value transactions in a secure and technology-driven environment.
o  The Payments Bank will be registered as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 2013, and licensed under Banking Regulation Act, 1949. So statement 1 is correct.
o  The Payments Bank cannot set up subsidiaries to undertake non-banking financial services activities.
The other financial and non-financial services activities of the promoters, if any, should be kept distinctly ring-fenced and not commingled with the banking and financial services business of the Payments Bank. So statement 2 is correct.
o  The Payments Bank cannot undertake lending activities, hence statement 3 is incorrect.
o  Payments Bank will have to comply with SLR and CRR requirements. So statement 4 is correct.

Q 26.C
o  Manufactured goods constitute the bulk of exports over 63 per cent in recent years, followed by crude and petroleum products (including coal) with a 20 per cent share, and agriculture and allied products with a share of 13.7 per cent.
o  One of the major items in India's import basket is the POL group, which accounted for 36.6 per cent of India's total imports followed by manufacture goods and precious metals (Gold and Silver).

Q 27.A
o  PDMA is a body corporate to be run on the grants or loans received from the Central Government and from other sources as may be prescribed by the central government.
o  All debt management functions are now transferred to PDMA in respect of the central government and the RBI Act is amended accordingly. RBI is required by law (Finance Act, 2015) to provide all necessary information and assistance to the effective functioning of PDMA.
o  However, RBI may still be managing the borrowing requirements of the state governments as per the agreement it has entered into with them earlier.


5                                                                    www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
o  Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission report (2013) also recommended setting up the independent "Public Debt Management  Agency" (PDMA) at the earliest. Committee observed that management of public debt requires a specialized investment banking capability.
o  It will collect and publish information about public debt, including borrowings by the central government.
o  So statement 1 and 2 are incorrect as per explanation and 3rd statement is correct.

Q 28.C
o  The Nehruvian  Planning stressed on investment for capital accumulation in the spirit of the one- sector Harrod-Domar model, which argued that production required capital and that capital can be accumulated through investment; the faster one accumulates, the higher the growth rate will be.
o  Also Mahalanobis Model is based on the idea that in order to reach a high standard in consumption, investment in building a capacity in the production of capital goods is firstly needed. Thus, focus was on the  development of heavy industries.
o  The economy was not developed  enough to promote an export oriented growth model as it was basically closed economy and moreover we adopted an inward oriented strategy.

Q 29.D
o  In 1991, India faced an unprecedented balance of payments crisis. For almost a decade the government had borrowed heavily to support an economic strategy that relied on expansionary public spending to finance growth. From 1980 to 1991 India's domestic public debt increased steadily, from 36 percent to 56 percent of the GDP, while its external debt more than tripled to $70 billion. Thus, by early 1991, India was on the brink of default.
o  Thus, in June 1991, to launch India's first comprehensive economic policy reform program, which the World Bank supported with a $500 million structural adjustment  operation (SAL), approved in December 1991 and closed in December 1993.
o  The SAL's objectives were two fold :
o  (1) to help India address its immediate balance of payments crisis and (2) to support a broad set of policy reforms aimed at liberalizing the Indian economy and opening it up to more competition both from within and abroad. The SAL was complemented by an IMF-supported stabilization program.
o  These measures were followed by additional  conditionalities imposed by IMF to liberalize investment,  further deregulate trade policy, improve tax administration, and strengthen the financial sector.

Q 30.B


Q 31.A


The savings account deposits are not used to finance the five year plans.
o  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), continue to face constraints  in obtaining  adequate finance, particularly in terms of their ability to convert their trade receivables  into liquid funds. Thus, in order to address this pan-India issue through setting up of an institutional mechanism for financing trade receivables, the Reserve Bank of India had published a concept paper on "Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) Factoring-Trade Receivables Exchange" in March 2014.
o  This scheme is thus, for setting up and operating the institutional mechanism for facilitating the financing of trade receivables of MSMEs from corporate buyers through multiple financiers  and is known as Trade Receivables  Discounting  System (TReDS).
o  The TReDS will facilitate  the discounting  of both invoices as well as bills of exchange. Further, as the underlying entities are the same (MSMEs and corporate buyers) the TReDS could deal with both receivables factoring as well as reverse factoring so that higher transaction volumes come into the system and facilitate in better pricing.
o  MSME sellers, corporate buyers and financiers â€” both banks and non-bank (NBFC factors) - will be direct participants in the TReDS.
o  Hence, all the statements  are correct.

In his famous speech 'Freedom at midnight', the first prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru mentioned, "The ambition of the greatest men of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over.
o  The NDA government's first full-fledged economic survey authored by Arvind Subramanian, chief economic advisor in the Narendra Modi-led government, has a full chapter on 'Wiping Every Tear From Every Eye' : The JAM Number Trinity solution.
o  JAM is Jan Dhan Yojana, Adhaar, Mobile Number.
o  It is expected that JAM may wipe every tear from every eye.

Q 33.D
o  Transfer  Pricing is a price at which divisions of a company  transact  with each other. Transactions may include  the trade of supplies  or labor between  departments.  Transfer  prices are used when individual entities of a larger multi-entity firm are treated and measured as separately run entities.
o  Under Advance Pricing Agreement  scheme, the two competent  authorities  (tax authorities  of two countries) will negotiate in advance to determine the Arms Length Price of the future international transaction. This is called bilateral  APA.

o  The seventh five year plan (1985-90) focused on growth, modernization, self-reliance and social justice.
o  Annual Plans- 1990-91 and 1991 -92
o  Hence, all the statements are correct.

Q 35.C
o  Bank rate is charged by RBI on long term lendings such as lending to GoI, state governments, banks etc. while Repo rate is charged on short term lendings. So statement 1 is correct.
o  Reverse repo rate is interest rate which RBI pays to lender while repo rate is the rate at which RBI gives loans to others. So rate at which RBI gives loans is kept greater than rate at which RBI takes the loans. So reverse repo rate is less than repo rate. So statement 2 is incorrect.
o  Repo rate is used to control money supply in economy. If it is increased than money supply would decrease. So statement 3 is correct.

Q 36.A
     Cash Reserve Ratio is the ratio of total deposits of a bank which is to be maintained with RBI (and not with the bank itself) in the form of cash. Hence,1st  Statement is incorrect.
     The purpose of Cash Reserve Ratio is to ensure that banks do not run out of cash to meet the payment demands of their depositors. The other purpose is to control amount of cash in the economy. Hence, 2nd Statement  is correct.
     To meet SLR requirements various assets owned by bank like buildings canâ€™t be used. Hence, 3rd
Statement is incorrect.




7                                                                    www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
Q 37.B


     Paper with tenor beyond one year is known as dated security. At present, there are Central
Government dated securities with a tenor up to 30 years in the market.
     The long term bonds of the government are known as dated securities. Hence,
3rd   Statement is incorrect.

Q 38.B
o  Devaluing rupee will lead to increase in exports & hence will positively contribute to BoP. Hence 1st statement is correct.

o  Droughts and not floods occured during 1966 and 1967.
o  World Bank & IMF provided foreign currency with stiff conditions and aid was cut â€“ off due to
Indo - Pak war 1965.
o  Hence, Option b is correct

Q 40.A
o  Purchasing  Power Parity (PPP) is a method for determining where the currency exchange rate
'should' be. The theory is that currency exchange rates between two countries should be at a level where goods can be purchased at the same price in either country.
o  PPP is a measure of relative consumer prices and not producer. prices. Hence, 2nd Statement is
incorrect.
o  Example-.if an item costs $10 in the US, and $5 in China and $1 in India, the Chinese currency is undervalued by 50 percent and the Indian one by 90 percent. Thus, Indian Rupee is undervalued against the US Dollar.
o  Hence, only 1st Statement is correct.

Q 41.B
o  In this, public sector spending replaces, or drives down, private sector spending.
o  It occurs in expansionary fiscal policy causing interest rates to rise, thereby reducing investment spending.
o  Hence, Option b is correct.

Q 42.B

These means are given below in order of their suggested and tried preferences.
I.    External Aids are the best money as a means to fulfill a government's deficit requirements even if it is coming with soft interest. If they are coming without interest nothing could be better.
II.   External Borrowings are the next best way to manage fiscal deficit with the condition that the
external loans are comparatively cheaper and long-term.
(a)  External borrowings come in foreign currency/hard currency which gives extra edge to the government spending as by this the government may fulfill its developmental requirements inside the country as well as from outside the country.
(b)  It is preferred over the internal borrowings due to crowding out effect. If the government itself goes on borrowing from the banks of the country, from where will others borrow for investment purposes?
III.  Internal Borrowings comes as the third preferred route of fiscal deficit management.

8                                                                    www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
IV. Printing Currency is the last resort for the government in managing its deficit. But it has the biggest handicap that with it the government cannot go for the expenditures which are to be made in the foreign currency.

Q 43.C
o  If the market rate of interest is already low enough so that everybody expects it to rise in future, causing capital losses, nobody will wish to hold bonds.
o  Everyone in the economy will hold their wealth in money balance and if additional money is injected within the economy it will be used up to satiate people's craving for money balances without increasing the demand for bonds and without further lowering the rate of interest. Such a situation is called a liquidity trap.

Q 44.C
o  Macroeconomic Vulnerability Index, as mentioned in the Mid-Year Economic Analysis 2014-2015, released by Ministry of Finance and Economic Survey 2014-15 recently, which adds together the rate of inflation, current account deficit and fiscal deficit of a country. The Index value can be compared across countries for different time periods to gauge their relative vulnerability.
o  The Ministry has done a comparison of the "fragile five"    countrie's-Brazil, India, Indonesia, South
Africa and Turkey.
o  Today, India's fortunes have improved dramatically and India demonstrated the greatest improvement in the MVI while many others maintained the status quo or showed only a marginal improvement or deteriorated dramatically (Russia). India is still more vulnerable than the mean of countries in its investor rating category (BBB) but is less so than many of its larger emerging market peers.
Q 45.D Q 46.B Q 47.D
o  Headline Inflation  is a measurement of price inflation that takes into account all types of
inflation that an economy can experience. Unlike core inflation, headline inflation also counts changes in the price of food and energy.
o  Because food and energy prices can rapidly increase while other types of inflation can remain low, headline inflation may not give an accurate picture of how an economy is behaving.
o  Headline inflation is more useful for the typical household because it reflects changes in the cost of living, while core inflation is used by central banks because core inflation is less volatile and shows the effects of supply and demand on GDP better.
o  Hence, Option d is correct.

Q 48.D
o  Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country (RBI in case of India) lends money to commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds. Repo rate is used by monetary authorities to control inflation by reducing the money supply in the economy. In the event of inflation, central banks increase repo rate as this acts as a disincentive for banks to borrow from the central bank. This  ultimately  reduces  the money  supply  in the  economy  and  thus  helps  in arresting  inflation. Hence 1st statement is correct.
o  Reverse repo rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country (Reserve Bank of India in case of India) borrows money from commercial banks within the country. It is a monetary policy instrument which can be used to control the money supply in the country.

reverse repo rate means that commercial  banks will get more incentives  to park their funds with the RBI, thereby decreasing the supply of money in the market. Hence 2nd statement is correct.

Q 49.D
o  India  followed  a pegged  or fixed  exchange  rate  system  before  1991.  Now  it follows  a managed exchange  rate  system  where  RBI  intervenes  by  selling  or  buying  the  foreign  currency  in  the exchange market to stabilize the rupee. Such an exercise was taken by RBI last year when the rupee value saw a steep decline.
o  Sterilization refers to the process where RBI reduces the liquidity in the economy that occurs due to increased inflow of foreign investments. Since foreign currency is converted into rupee, it results in greater liquidity & causes inflation.  To manage it RBI sells the government  securities  in the open market to reduce the liquidity.  The  stabilization of rupee  may  be an implied  effect  but  not  the basic purpose of sterilization.
o  Hence, both the statements  are incorrect.

o  The Real Effective  Exchange  Rate (REER) is calculated as the weighted average of the real exchange rates of all its trade partners, the weights being the shares of the respective countries in its foreign trade. It is interpreted as the quantity of domestic goods required to purchase one unit of a given basket of foreign goods.
o  Statement  1 and 2 interchanges  the features of both term. 3rd statement  is true regarding  REER.

Q 57.D
o  Higher employment growth may not lead to lower unemployment rate if the growth rate of job seekers is higher than employment growth rate. Hence 1st statement is incorrect.
o  Similarly, higher GDP growth may not lead to higher employment growth. A jobless growth may result when a macro-economy experiences growth while maintaining or decreasing its level of employment. Hence 2nd statement is incorrect.

o  Some modified measures including the credit default swaps are also used in debt restructuring to hedge against the losses.
o  PCR of private banks is higher than the public sector banks in India.
Provision  Coverage Ratio (PCR)
o  PCR is the ratio of provision to gross non-performing assets (NPAs).
o  A key relationship in analyzing asset quality of the bank.
o  A measure that indicates the extent to which the bank has provided against the troubled part of its loan portfolio.
o  A high ratio suggests that additional provisions to be made by the bank in the coming years would be relatively low (if gross NPAs do not rise at a faster clip).
o  Thus, PCR refers to the percentage of the loan amount that the bank has set aside as provisions to meet an eventuality where the loan might have to be written off it becomes irrecoverable.
o  It is a measure that indicates the extent to which the bank has provided (set aside money to bear the loss) against the troubled part of its loan portfolio.
o  PCR  = Cumulative provisions / Gross NPAs.
11                                                                 www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS

o  Also, the volume of debt would rise in local currency terms. This is known as Debt Overhang. Hence
2nd statement is incorrect.
o  In case of an export market, export receivables can offset to some extent the currency risk in debt payments. Hence 3rd statement is correct.

Q 61.D
o  The divisible  pool is that portion of gross tax revenue which is distributed between the Centre and the States. The divisible pool consists of all taxes, except surcharges and cess levied for specific purpose, net of collection charges. Thus option 1st statement is incorrect.
o  The distinction between Special Category States and General Category States still exists. Hence 2nd is incorrect.
o  The FFC has suggested more share in the divisible pool of taxes and more autonomy to the states in use of these funds which would lead to fiscal federalism. Hence statement 3rd is correct.
o  As per the mandate of Finance Commission it would suggest measures, if needed, to augment State government finances to supplement the resources of local government and to review the state of the finances, deficit and debt conditions at different levels of government. Accordingly grants to rural and urban local bodies has been proposed. Hence, 4th statement is correct.

Q 62.D
o  It pressed for import substitution.
o  The basic premise behind Mahalanobis-Feldman (FM) model is very simple. The model prescribes that to reach higher standards of consumption and bigger growth in the consumer goods sector one must first stimulate the capital goods sector by channeling more investments in that sector.
o  An economy has to build up capacity in the production of capital goods before concentrating on the consumer goods sector. In the short run, the capital goods sector matter. However, in the long run increased capacity in the capital goods sector expands the capacity in the production of consumer goods.

Q 63.A

Q 64.C


Statements 1, 2 and 4 are correct. Statement 3 is wrong as Tax avoidance is of international concern now and several countries have either already codified GAAR in their tax statutes or are in the process of doing so.
o  The regulation allows tax officials to deny tax benefits, if a deal is found without any commercial purpose other than tax avoidance.
o  It allows tax officials to target participatory notes. Under GAAR, the investor has to prove that the participatory note was not set to avoid taxes. It also allows officials to deny double taxation avoidance benefits, if deals made in tax havens like Mauritius were found to be avoiding taxes.

    Kelkar committee report has told about four ways to cut fiscal deficit namely,
1. Tax measures and better administration.
2. Increase disinvestment proceeds
3. Cutting down subsidies
4. Right sizing plan expenditure.  (cutting the plan expenditure would eventually prove a negative influence in the long run, the correct word is right sizing as in rightsizing both increase and decrease can happen, hence option 3 is also incorrect.

Q 66.A
o  Withholding tax, which levied on income (interest and dividends) from securities owned by a non- resident.
o  The amount withheld is a credit against the income taxes the employee must pay during the year.

Q 73.B
o  To keep a check  on rupee depreciation  , RBI has raised the gap between  MSF and Repo Rate to
300  basis point i(i.e.3% above the Repo Rate) in July 2013 . Increasing MSF reduces money supply for  speculation  which  in  turn  strengthens  rupee  value  in  international  market.  So  option  1  is incorrect.
o  The purpose of marginal standing facility is to reduce volatility in the overnight lending rates in the interbank  market  and  to enable  smooth  monetary  transmission  in the economy.  So  option  2 is correct.
o  Marginal standing facility is generally kept higher (1%) than Repo Rate in India as it is an interest rate for very short term loans. So option 3 is incorrect.

Q 74.A

o  Fiscal drag describes the phenomenon whereby more people move into higher tax brackets because tax allowances and tax are not adjusted in line with inflation or earning growth, therefore money income goes down, whereas real income goes down.
o  This fiscal drag has the effect of reducing Aggregate Demand and becomes an example of deflationary fiscal policy. It could also be viewed as an automatic fiscal stabiliser because higher earnings growth will lead to higher tax and therefore moderate inflationary pressure in the economy.

Q 75.D
o  Rice forms an important part of National Food Security Act.

o  The Government has scrapped the supply of subsidised kerosene through the Public Distribution System (PDS). The Centre plans to write to States asking them to provide subsidised kerosene only to un-electrified households.
o  States, which have achieved near 100 per cent electrification, will be incentivised to become kerosene-free. In the remaining States, un-electrified households will be given the choice between cash subsidy in lieu of kerosene allocation and upfront subsidy for greener solar lighting systems.
o  The allocation of kerosene subsidy will now be in accordance with Census 2011 data, which shows
that it’s no longer, a fuel of choice for cooking but is used for lighting purposes.
The Census showed that kerosene has been almost completely replaced by LPG in urban and semi- urban areas and biomass is the cooking fuel of choice in the rural areas

Q 76.D
o  Increase in repo rate decreases  money supply in the economy  which is used to curb inflation.  So option 1 is correct.
o  Ban of export of certain products raises supply of those products in the country’s economy so prices of those products reduce. So option 2 is correct.
14                                                                 www.visionias.in                                                         ©Vision IAS
o  Earlier  RBI  used  WPI  indexes  as  a  key  measure  for  inflation  but  now  it  has  switched  to  CPI (combined)  as  a  key  measure  of  inflation  and  take  monitory  policy  decision  according  to  CPI (combined). So option 3 is correct.

Q 77.C
o  Primary deficit=Fiscal Deficit – Net Interest Liabilities. Thus, if the primary deficit is low in spite of high fiscal deficit, it means that the interest liabilities are high.
o  Effective revenue deficit = Revenue deficit - expenditure on creation and maintenance of assets out of revenue account. Effective revenue deficit can be low due to high spending on capital assets out of the revenue account as well as low revenue deficit itself. Hence, only low effective revenue
deficit is not a complete indicator unless revenue deficit is known. Hence, option c is correct answer

Q 78.C
o  Producer subsidy is given to the producer while the consumer subsidy is given to the consumer.
o  Railways do not receive producer subsidy and only the consumer fares are subsidized.
o  Electricity receives both producer and consumer subsidy.

Q 94.B



Q 95.D
o  The shifting in base year results in incorporation of new enterprises or accounts that may not have been included  in previous  base  year while  calculating  GDP.  It incorporates  more  comprehensive data set. In case of India  bringing  forward  the base year has resulted  in the increase  in growth percentage  because,  it has included  new  accounts  & enterprises.  However,  it is not  a universal truth.
o  For an economy that is shrinking  & the enterprises  & businesses  are closing a shifting forward of base year will have a negative impact while a shifting back of base year from current base year will have a positive impact on GDP growth rate. Hence, both the statements are incorrect.

Q 100.B
o  Inclusive   growth is  a  concept   that  advances   equitable   opportunities   for  all  the  participants during economic growth with benefits incurred by every section of society.
