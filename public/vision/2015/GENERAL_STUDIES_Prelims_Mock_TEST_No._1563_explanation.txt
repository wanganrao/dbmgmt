Q 1.A


Tax buoyancy is the measure for how tax revenues vary with changes in GDP. Hence  1st statement is correct.
A buoyancy of one would imply that an extra percent of GDP would increase tax revenue by one percent, thus leaving the tax to GDP ra  o unchanged. Tax buoyancy exceeding one, however would increase tax revenue by more than GDP and poten  ally lead to reduc  on in the deﬁcit ra  o. Hence 2nd statement is incorrect.
Tax evasion and tax collec  on lags are administra  ve factors which reduces Tax buoyancy,
Hence 3rd statement is incorrect.
A uniform taxa  on system such as GST will be more buoyant than Value added tax (VAT).
Hence 4th statement is incorrect and op  on (a) is the correct answer.

Q 2.C


The Sarasva   River  is one of the main Rigvedic rivers men  oned in the Rig Veda and later Vedic and post-Vedic texts. It plays an important role in Hinduism, since Vedic Sanskrit and the ﬁrst part of the Rig Veda are regarded to have originated when the Vedic people lived on its banks, 10,000 years ago. The goddess Sarasva    was originally a personiﬁca  on of this river, but later developed an independent iden  ty. Hence, 1st statement is correct.
The Nadistu hymn in the Rigveda men  ons the Sarasva    between the Yamuna in the east and the Sutlej in the west.
Satellite images in possession of the ISRO and ONGC have conﬁrmed that the major course of a river ran through the present day Ghaggar River. Hence, 3rd statement is correct.

Q 3.B


SUMMER  -  When the Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer and the North Temperate
Zone experiences summer.
WINTER     -    When the Sun is at the Tropic of Capricorn and the North Temperate Zone experiences winter.
SPRING    -   When the Sun is directly overhead the Equator.
AUTUMN  -    When the Sun returns to the Equator, the North Temperate Zone experiences autumn.
Hence op  on (b) is the correct answer.

Q 4.B


Fiscal consolida  on is a policy intended to reduce deﬁcits and the accumula  on of debt, according  to  the  Organisa  on  for  Economic  Co-opera  on  and  Development.  The  term typically refers to a government economic policy.
In Indian context, It is be  er to achieve ﬁscal consolida  on partly through a higher tax-GDP ra  o than  merely  through  reduc  on in the expenditure  to GDP  ra  o,  in view of  large unmet development needs.
A  er reaching a peak of 11.9 per cent in 2007-08, the tax-GDP ra  o had declined to 9.6 per cent in 2009-10 and was placed at 9.9 per cent in 2011-12. Therefore, raising the tax-GDP ra  o to above the 11 per cent level is cri  cal for sustaining the process of ﬁscal consolida  on in the long run. Of course, it is much be  er to achieve a higher tax-GDP ra  o by broadening the  base  which  is  taxed  rather  than  increasing  marginal  tax  rates  signiﬁcantly--higher and higher tax rates impinge more and more on incen  ves to undertake taxable ac  vity, while encouraging tax evasion.
ï»¿Hence, only 2nd statement is correct.

Q 5.D


Lok  Adalat  is  a  forum  where  the  disputes/cases  pending  in  the  court  of  law  or  at pre-li  ga  on stage are se  led/compromised amicably.
The Lok Adalat has been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authori  es Act,
1987.
Under the said Act, the award made by the Lok Adalats is deemed to be the decree of a civil court and is ﬁnal and binding on all par  es and no appeal lies before any court against its award.
Lok  Adalat  has  the  jurisdicon  to  se  le,  by  way  of  eﬀec  ng  compromise  between  the par  es,  any  ma  er  which  may  be  pending  before  any  court,  as  well  as  ma  ers  at pre-li  ga  ve stage i.e. disputes which have not yet been formally ins  tuted in any Court of Law. Such ma  ers may be civil or criminal in nature, but any ma  er rela  ng to an oﬀence not compoundable under any law cannot be decided by the Lok Adalat even if the par  es involved  therein  agree  to  se  le  the  same.  Lok  adalats  can  take  cognizance  of  ma  ers involving not only those persons who are en  tled to avail free legal services but of all other persons also, be they women, men, or children and even ins  tuons. The Lok Adalat is presided over by a sing or re  red judicial oﬃcer or other person of respect and legal knowledge as the chairman, with two other members, usually a lawyer and a social worker.

The Criminal Procedure Code discusses three kinds of  oﬀences as follows: Bailable and non-bailable oﬀences; Bailable oﬀences are those in which the accused has the right to get bail. Non-bailable oﬀences, on the other hand, are those in which the decision to grant bail or not rests with the court. Bailable oﬀences are less serious in nature than non-bailable ones.
Cognizable and non-cognizable oﬀences: Cognizable oﬀences are those in which the police oﬃcer can arrest an oﬀender without a warrant. In non-cognizable oﬀences, the police oﬃcer  cannot  arrest  without  a  warrant.  Cognizable  oﬀences  are  more  serious  than non-cognizable ones.
Compoundable and non-compoundable oﬀences: Compoundable oﬀences are those which can be compromised by the par  es to the dispute. The permission of the court is not necessary. When an oﬀence is compounded, the party, who has been aggrieved by the oﬀence, is compensated for his grievance. Suppose your car accidentally hits a person on the road and he is injured. Though you may be guilty of rash and negligent driving, you can se  le the ma  er by paying some money to the vic  m.
Note that only the aggrieved party or the vic  m may compound an oﬀence. Not even the public prosecutor has the power to compound an oﬀence.

Ununsep  um is a superheavy ar  ﬁcial chemical element with temporary symbol Uus and atomic number 117. The element, also known as eka-asta  ne or simply element 117, is the second-heaviest of all the elements(Its isotope Ununoc  um    is considered heaviest ). Its discovery was ﬁrst announced in 2010â€”synthesis was claimed in Dubna, Russia, by a joint Russian-American collabora  on, thus making it the most recently discovered element. Recently its discovery was conﬁrmed. It was part of this conﬁrma  on team not discoverer team.
It was created by combining calcium and berkelium.
Elements heavier than uranium (with 92 protons) are not usually found in nature, but they can be forced into existence in laboratories.
Element 117â€™s existence gives scien  sts hope, however, that they are ge   ng closer to discovering a rumored â€œisland of stabilityâ€ where nuclei with so-called magic numbers of protons and neutrons become long-lived.
Elements beyond atomic number 104 are called superheavy elements, but so far all have been found to have short half-lives, which is their rate of decay.
Super-heavy elements, may refer to elements beyond atomic number 100, but also may refer to all transuranium elements. The transac  nide elements begin with rutherfordium (atomic number 104).
But so far all Super-heavy elements have been found to have short half-lives.

Foreign  banks,  with  20  branches  and  above,  already  have  priority  sector  targets  and sub-targets are under the scheme. Whereas, the foreign banks with less than 20 branches are not subject to the scheme as of now. ï»¿Hence, 2nd statement is incorrect.
Q 32.D
The Earth's internal heat source provides the energy for our dynamic planet, supplying it with the driving force for plate-tectonic mo  on, and for on-going catastrophic events such as earthquakes and volcanic erup  ons. This internal heat energy was much greater in the early stages  of  the  Earth  than  it  is  today,  having  accumulated  rapidly  by  heat  conversion associated with three separate processes, all of which were most intense during the ﬁrst few hundred thousand years of the Earth's history: (1) extraterrestrial impacts, (2) gravita  onal contrac  on   of   the   Earth's   interior,   and   (3)   the   radioac  ve   decay   of   unstable
isotopes. ï»¿Hence all the statements are correct.

Most scien  sts believe that our solar system evolved from the accre  on of solid par  cles derived from a large nebular cloud - the so-called Nebular Hypothesis. Under this scenario, proto-planet Earth would have grown over   me from a barrage of extraterrestrial impacts, increasing its mass with each bombardment. As the proto-planet grew in size its increased gravita  onal ﬁeld would have a  racted even more objects its surface. The composi  on of these colliding  bodies  would have included metal-rich fragments (i.e.., iron  meteorites), rocky fragments (i.e., stony meteorites), and icy fragments (i.e., comets). Although accre  on was much more prevalent in the early stages of the Earth's history, these extraterrestrial collisions are s  ll occurring today, exempliﬁed by shoo  ng stars and ﬁreballs in the night sky, and by the occasional impact of larger bodies on the Earth's surface. Such par  cles travel at great veloci  es, typically ~30,000--50,000 km/hr, similar to that of the Earth as it rotates around the Sun. The very large amount of kine  c energy inherent in these moving bodies is instantly converted to heat energy upon impact, thus providing a component to the Earth's
internal heat source

Hence statement 4 is incorrect.
Indiaâ€™s Largest News Agency, Press Trust of India (PTI) is non-proﬁt sharing coopera  ve owned by the countryâ€™s newspapers with a mandate to provide eﬃcient and unbiased news to all subscribes. Hence , 1st statement is incorrect.
Press Council is a statutory quasi-judicial authority mandated by the Parliament to preserve the freedom of the press and maintain and improve the standards of newspapers and the news agencies in India. It is an autonomous body with equal quasi-judicial authority over the authori  es and the press persons.
The Press  Informa  on  Bureau,  commonly abbreviated as PIB, is a nodal agency of the Government  of  India.  Based  in  Na  onal  Media  Centre,  New  Delhi.  It  disseminates informa  on  to  the  print,  electronic  and  new  media  on  government  plans,  policies, programme ini  a  ves and achievements. The PIB is also the Government's nodal agency to facilitate private media.Hence, 2nd statement is correct.

A Parliament  Secretary  o  en  holds  the  rank  of  Minister  of  State  and  has  the  same en  tlements and is assigned to a government department.  Manipur, HP, Mizoram, Assam, Rajasthan, Punjab, Goa are some of the states where MLAs have been appointed Parliament Secretaries by the Government.
PILs  ﬁled  in  various  High  Courts  on  the  ma  er  have  argued  that  the  appointment  of
Parliament Secretaries is ultra vires the 91st Amendment.
Recently Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwalâ€™s decision to appoint 21 MLAs as â€˜parliamentary secretaries (PS)â€™ to assist his six ministers has drawn sharp cri  cism from the Congress and BJP which called it a waste of public money and a way to oblige his

men.The State Government, on the other hand, had recently said that the Parliamentary Secretaries would not receive any remunera on or perks of any kind. They could use government  transport  for  oﬃcial  purpose  and  u  lise  space  in  the  Minister's  oﬃce  to facilitate their work.

Background

Appointments and Func ons of Parliamentary Secretary

In the United Kingdom, a Minister who is a member Of one House, cannot go to the other House of Parliament. Therefore, a member of the House other than the one to which a Minister belongs, is appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to help his Minister and depuse for the Minister in that House. The Parliamentary Secretary has a status below that of a Cabinet Minister and a Minister of State. He is a paid servant and as he is not a Minister, who must  be  careful  not  to  speak  or  to  conduct  himself  as  if  he  was  a  member  of  the Government.
In India, the ins  tuon Of the oﬃce Of Parliamentary Secretary has no statutory origin nor does it derive authority from the Cons  tuon of India. The oﬃce Of the Parliamentary Secretary in India was ﬁrst created in 1951, purely for the purpose of assis  ng the Minister in parliamentary work. Unlike the Ministers,' the oath to the Parliamentary Secretaries is administered by the Prime Minister and not by the President.


The appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary is en  rely at the discre  on of the Prime Minister, who decides when and who should be appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary. The func  ons of a Parliamentary Secretary are as under:

i. He will assist the Minister in his oﬃcial work.
ii. He will represent the Department/ Ministry in the House to which he belongs. iii. He will perform such func  ons as may be assigned to him by the Minister.

Q 38.D

Arbitra  on

Arbitra  on is a process in which a neutral third party or par  es render a decision based on the merits of the case. In the Indian context the scope of the rules for the arbitra  on process are set out  broadly  by  the  provisions  of  the  Arbitra  on  and  Concilia  on  Act  1998  and  in  the  areas uncovered by the Statute the par  es are free to design an arbitra  on process appropriate and relevant to their disputes.

Media  on

The process of media  on aims to facilitate the development of a consensual  soluon  by  the dispu  ng par  es. The media  on process is overseen by a non-par  san third party - the Mediator. The authority of the mediator vests on the consent of the par  es that he should facilitate their nego  a  ons.

Concilia  on

This  is  a  process  by  which  resoluon  of  disputes  is  achieved  by  compromise  or  voluntary agreement. In contrast to arbitra  on, the conciliator does not render a binding award.

Q 44.C

Rahtriya Krishi Bima Yojana intends to provide insurance cover and ﬁnancial support to the farmers in the event of failure of crops as a result of natural calami  es like natural ﬁre, lightening, storms, cyclone, ﬂood, draught, pests and diseases.

The salient features of the Scheme are :

It is available to all the farmers irrespec  ve of their size of holding.
The scheme will be compulsory for loanee farmers and op  onal farmers.
No restric  on on total sum insured and it can be of the value of the threshold yield of the crop with an op  on to cover upto 150% of average yield of the crop for extra premium.
All the crops will be covered and in addi  on three cash crops like sugarcane, potato and co  on are brought under the purview of the scheme. Hence, only 3rd statement is incorrect. Rest all are correct.
Remaining  crops  including  hor  cultural  and  commercial  crops  will  be  placed  under  the scheme within the next three years.
In case the premium rates worked out on the basis of actuarial data are less than the prescribed premium rates, the lower rate will be applicable.
In case of the commercial and hor  cultural crops actuarial rates will be charged.
Transion to the actuarial regime will be achieved in ﬁve years so as to make it sustainable. For small and marginal farmers, a subsidy of 50% on the premium.
Premium subsidy to be phased out over a period of ﬁve years. Scheme will be operated on the basis of Area Approach.
All farmers of a deﬁned area aﬀected by a calamity will be en  tled to payment of insurance according to the indemnity rates prescribed for the area.
In case of localised calami  es like hailstorm, landslides, cyclone, ﬂood etc., individual claims will be entertained.
Number of crop cu   ng experiments will be increased suitably in order to arrive at a realis  c assessment of threshold yield level in a par  cular area.
Though ini  ally General Insurance Corpora  on of India will implement the Scheme, in due course of   me an exclusive organisa  on will be set up to administer this Scheme.

Q 45.C
According  to  the  Interna  onal  Astronomical  Union,  which  sets  deﬁni  ons  for  planetary science, a dwarf planet is a celes  al body that: i) orbits the sun ii) has enough mass to assume a nearly round shape iii) has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit iv) is not a satellite (moon). Hence, only 2nd statement is incorrect. Rest all are correct.
The main dis  nc  on between a dwarf planet and a planet is that planets have cleared the path around the sun while dwarf planets tend to orbit in zones of similar objects that can cross their path around the sun, such as the asteroid and Kupier Belts. Dwarf planets also are generally smaller than the planet Mercury.
The ﬁrst ﬁve recognized dwarf planets are Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Makemake and Haumea.
Scien  sts believe there may be dozens or even more than 100 dwarf planets awai  ng discovery.

Q 51.D
All the above op  ons are included under the concept of sustainable development.
The term sustainable development originated in the 1970s and was ﬁrst promoted in the interna  onal environmental and development communi  es with the publica  on of World Conserva  on Strategy (1980). It was popularised by the Brundtland Report, also known as Our Common Future (1987) and further elaborated in Caring for the Earth (1991).
The Brundtland  Report  highlighted  three  fundamental components  to sustainable  development:
environmental protec  on, economic growth and social equity.
Nowadays, the most widely used deﬁni  on of sustainable development is the one put forth by Our Common Future, which states that Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future genera  ons to meet their own needs.

Q 54.B
Bharatnatyam-originated  in  Tamil  Nadu,  name  possibly  derived  from  Bharat.  In  Natya Shastra,  Bharatanatyam  is  described  as  ekaharya  in  which  one  dancer  depicts  many roles. Siva as Nataraja, the Lord of Dance is depicted in various dance forms. Bharatnatyam leans heavily on the abhinaya or mime aspect of dance â€“ the nritya, where the dancer expresses the sahitya through movement and mime (gestures and facial expression). Bharatanatyam is usually accompanied by the classical music. It is prac  ced by both male and female dancers.
Kathakali-  Evolved from many social and religious theatrical forms of Kerala.  This dance form  is  a  blend  of  dance,  music  and  ac  ng  and  drama  zes  stories,  which  are  mostly adapted from the Indian epics. Kathakali is considered to be a combina  on of ﬁve elements of ﬁne art: Expressions (Natyam, the component with emphasis on facial expressions) Dance (Nritham, the component of dance with emphasis on rhythm and movement of hands, legs and body) Enactment (Nrithyam, the element of drama with emphasis on â€œmudrasâ€, which are hand gestures) Song/vocal accompaniment (Geetha) Instrument accompaniment (Vadyam).
Mohiniya  am- It is a classical dance form from Kerala.It is considered a very graceful form of dance meant to be performed as solo recitals by women.There are approximately 40 basic movements, known as atavukal. The vocal music of Mohiniya  am involves varia  ons in rhythmic structure known as chollu.
Hence, correct op  on is (b) only

Q 56.B
In 1950, Dutch astronomer Jan Oort proposed that certain comets come from a vast, extremely distant, spherical shell of icy bodies surrounding  the solar  system.  This  giant swarm of objects is now named the Oort Cloud, occupying space at a distance between
5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units. (One astronomical unit, or AU, is the mean distance of Earth from the sun: about 150 million km or 93 million miles.) The outer extent of the Oort Cloud is believed to be in the region of space where the sun's gravita  onal inﬂuence is weaker than the inﬂuence of nearby stars.
The Oort Cloud probably contains 0.1 to 2 trillion icy bodies in solar orbit. Occasionally, giant molecular clouds, stars passing nearby, or   dal interac  ons with the Milky Way's disc disturb the orbits of some of these bodies in the outer region of the Oort Cloud, causing the object to fall into the inner solar system as a so-called long-period comet. These comets have very large, eccentric orbits and take thousands of years to circle the sun. In recorded history, they are observed in the inner solar system only once.





Q 57.A
Asian brown cloud, a large atmospheric brown cloud that occurs annually from about November through May over eastern China and southern Asia. Hence  op  on  (a)  is  the correct answer.
Atmospheric brown clouds, which appear as a dark haze on the horizon, are formed from a cocktail  of  warming  and  cooling  aerosols  (such  as  soot  and  dust)  in  the  atmosphere produced in the combus  on of fossil fuels and biomass across the region.
It has been linked to decreases in summer monsoon rainfall in India since 1930, the southward  shi     of  the  summer  monsoon  in  eastern  China,  declines  in  agricultural produc  on,  and  increases  in  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  problems  in  the  people inhabi  ng the region.

Q 58.B


In  1973,  the  Debra  Commission  created  Primi  ve  Tribal  Groups  (PTGs)  as  a  separate
category, who are less developed among the tribal groups. In 2006, the Government of India renamed the PTGs as Par  cularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
Among scheduled tribes there are certain tribal communi  es who have declining or stagnant popula  on, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward. 75 such groups in 17 States and 1 Union Territory have been iden  ﬁed and categorized as Primi ve Tribal Groups (PTGs). Only 1 UT is there Andaman & Nicobar, lakshadweep is not included.

Q 59.D
The  six languages which are included in the list of Classical Languages are : Tamil  (since
2004) Sanskrit  (since 2005) Telugu (since 2008) Kannada  (Since 2008) Malayalam  (since
2013) Odiya (since 2014) .
The Government of India currently follows the following criteria to determine the eligibility of language to be considered for classiﬁca  on as “classical language”:
High an  quity of its early texts/ recorded history over a period of 1500-2000 years.
A body of ancient literature/ texts, which is considered a valuable heritage by genera  ons of speakers.
The literary tradi  on be original and not borrowed from another speech community.
The  classical  language  and  literature  being  dis  nct  from  modern,  there  may  also  be  a
discon  nuity between the classical language and its later forms or its oﬀshoots.


Q 60.A
India has set a target for inﬂa  on in a landmark change in its monetary policy.
The objec  ve of the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement is to primarily maintain price stability  (containing  inﬂa  on) while keeping in mind the objec  ve of growth. Hence  1st statement is correct.
India’s monetary policy framework will be operated by the central bank.
Under ‘Monetary Policy Framework Agreement’ RBI will look to contain consumer price inﬂa  on within 6% by January 2016 and within 4% with a band of 2 percentage points for all subsequent years.
Under its framework if the central bank misses the inﬂa  on target, it will send a report to the government ci  ng reasons and remedial ac  ons.
The central bank will also need to give an es  mated    me-period within which it expects to return to the target level.

Q 68.C
Black Hole is not Dark Ma  er. Black Holes are gravity lenses which bends light. ï»¿Hence,
3rd statement is incorrect.
Normal Ma  er is made up of par  cles called baryons. ï»¿Hence, 4th statement is incorrect. In astronomy and cosmology, dark ma  er is a type of ma  er hypothesized to account for a large part of the total mass in the universe.
Dark ma  er cannot be seen directly with telescopes; evidently it neither emits nor absorbs light or other electromagne  c radia  on at any signiﬁcant level.
Its existence and proper  es are inferred  from its gravita  onal eﬀects on visible ma  er, radia  on, and the large-scale structure of the universe.
Dark ma  er is es  mated to cons  tute 84% of the ma  er in the universe and 23% of the total energy density (with almost all the rest being dark energy).
It is called dark ma  er because it does not interact with light. Dark ma  er interacts with ordinary ma  er through gravity and binds galaxies together like invisible glue.
While  dark  ma  er  pulls  ma  er  together,  dark  energy  pushes  the  universe  apart  at ever-increasing speeds. In terms of the total mass-energy content of the universe, dark energy dominates. Even less is known about dark energy than dark ma  er.
NASA has teamed up with the European Space Agency to probe the existence of dark ma  er. Euclid is ESAâ€™s mission, a space telescope designed to inves gate the cosmological mysteries of dark ma  er and dark energy will launch in 2020.

Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) are used as instruments for pooling of investment for infrastructure projects like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), which have been successfully used as instruments for pooling of investment in several countries.
These structures would reduce the pressure on the banking system while also making available fresh equity. Both the instruments would a  ract long-term ﬁnance from foreign and domes  c sources including the NRIs. Hence 1st, 2nd and 3rd statements are correct.
Any person who wishes to carry on the ac  vi  es of InvITs would have to obtain appropriate registra  on from SEBI. Hence 4th statement is incorrect. Hence (b) is the correct answer

Q 71.D
Genome  sequencing  is  ﬁguring  out  the  order  of  DNA  nucleo  des,  or  bases,  in  a genome—the order of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that make up an organism's DNA. The human genome is made up of over 3 billion of these gene  c le  ers.
genes account for less than 25 percent of the DNA in the genome, and so knowing the en  re genome sequence will help scien  sts study the parts of the genome outside the genes. This includes the regulatory regions that control how genes are turned on an oﬀ, as well as long stretches  of  "nonsense"  or  "junk" DNA—so called  because we don't  yet  know  what,  if anything, it does.

Q 75.D
For the examina  on, a detail piece of ar  cle is given.
The report of the Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) was tabled in Parliament yesterday. The government has accepted its far-reaching, indeed radical, recommenda  ons that have the poten  al to redeﬁne Indian federalism in a long overdue and desirable manner. This piece describes the key recommenda  ons and highlights some of their major implica  ons. It is based on upda  ng assump  ons in the FFC report, which is the only source of data used in the numbers presented below. The discussion below, especially the es  mates, should be seen as illustra  ve at best.
Ver  cal and horizontal devolu  on
The FFC has increased the amount that the Centre has to transfer to the states from the divisible pool of taxes by 10 percentage points, from 32 per cent to 42 per cent. Its radical nature is indicated by the comparison with the previous two Finance Commissions (FCs) that increased the share going to the states by 1 and 1.5 percentage points, respec  vely. So, the FFC recommenda  ons represent a ten and six-and-a-half fold increase, respec  vely rela  ve to  the  previous  two  FCs.  Had  the  new  share  been  implemented  in  2014-15  (Budget es  mates), the Centre’s ﬁscal resources would have shrunk by about 1.20 lakh crore (0.9 per cent of gross domes  c product or GDP). If the comparison were to be in terms of overall (tax plus non-plan grants) devolu  on, the increase would be roughly comparable to that in tax devolu  on.
In addi  on, the FFC has signiﬁcantly changed the sharing of resources between the states — what  is  called  horizontal  devolu  on.  The  FFC  has  proposed  a  new  formula  for  the distribu  on  of  the  divisible  tax  pool  among  the  states.  There  are  changes  both  in  the variables included/excluded as well as the weights assigned to them. Rela ve to the Thirteenth  Finance  Commission,  the  FFC  has  incorporated  two  new  variables:  2011 popula  on and forest cover; and excluded the ﬁscal discipline variable.Several other types of transfers  have  been  proposed,  including  grants  to  rural  and  urban  local  bodies,  a performance grant, and grants for disaster relief and reducing the revenue deﬁcit of eleven states. These transfers total approximately 5.3 lakh crore for the period 2015-20.
Uniformly large addi  on to states’ resources
The impact of FFC transfers to the states needs to be assessed in two ways: gross and “net” FFC  transfers  will  clearly  add  to  the  resources  of  all  the  states  in  absolute  terms  and substan  ally. They will also increase resources when scaled by states’ popula  on, net state domes  c product, or own tax revenues, with the la  er conno  ng the addi  on to ﬁscal spending power.
Implemen  ng the FFC recommenda  ons alone would undermine the centre’s ﬁscal posi  on substan  ally. The philosophy of the FFC report is that there should be some corresponding reduc  on in the central assistance to states (CAS, the so-called plan transfers). Thus, greater ﬁscal autonomy to the states would be achieved both on the revenue side (on account of states now having more resources and more un  ed resources) and on the expenditure side because  of  reduced  CAS  transfers.  The  exact  mechanism  for  implementa  on  will  be discussed in the months ahead but the legally backed schemes as well as ﬂagship schemes that meet core objec  ves, such as rural livelihoods and poverty allevia  on, will be, and need to be, preserved.
The net impact on the states will depend not just on the transfers eﬀected via the FFC, but
also the consequen  al altera  on of CAS. Under some simple assump  ons about how the la  er will be distributed, we ﬁnd that all states will end up be  er oﬀ than before, although there will be some varia  on amongst the states.
Increase in progressivity of overall transfers
The  FFC  transfers  have  a  more  favourable impact on  the states  that  are  rela  vely  less developed, which is an indica  on that they are progressive, that is, states with lower per capita  net  state  domes  c  product  (NSDP)  are  likely  to  receive  on  average  much  larger transfers per capita . The correla  on between per capita NSDP and FFC transfers per capita is
-0.72 based on some broad assump  ons about FFC transfers. This indicates that the FFC recommenda  ons do go in  the direc  on  of  equalising the income and ﬁscal dispari  es between the major states.
In contrast, CAS transfers are only mildly progressive: the correla  on coeﬃcient with state per capita GDP (over the last three years) is -0.29. This is a consequence of plan transfers moving  away  from  being  formula-based  (Gadgil-Mukherjee  formula)  to  being  more discre  onary in the last few years. Greater central discre  on evidently reduced progressivity. A corollary is that implemen  ng the FFC recommenda  ons would help address inter-state resource inequality: progressive tax transfers would increase, while discre  onary and less progressive plan transfers would decline.
Weakening ﬁscal discipline?
Will FFC transfers lead to less ﬁscal discipline? There are two reasons to be op  mis  c. First, in the last few years the overall deﬁcit of the states has been about half of that of the Centre: in 2014-15 (Budget es  mates) for example, the combined ﬁscal deﬁcit of the states was es  mated at 2.4 per cent of GDP compared to 4.1 per cent for the Centre. So, on average, states, if anything, are more disciplined than the Centre.
Based on analysing recent state ﬁnances, we ﬁnd that addi  onal transfers toward the states as a result of the FFC will improve the overall ﬁscal deﬁcit of the combined central and state governments by about 0.3-0.4 per cent of GDP. Moreover, nearly all the state governments have enacted ﬁscal responsibility legisla  ons (FRLs), which requires them to observe high standards of ﬁscal discipline such as keeping the deﬁcit low.
Further, as part of the new Centre-state ﬁscal rela  ons, for example, under the NITI Aayog, mechanisms  for  peer  assessments  and  mutual  accountability  could  be  created,  and incen  ves  could  be  provided  for  maintaining  ﬁscal  discipline.  This  is  becoming  rou  ne prac  ce in many federal structures where sovereignty is shared between the members. The FFC  recommenda  ons  and  the  consequences  they  entail  oﬀer  an  opportune    me  for ins  tung such mechanisms.
Conclusions
With the caveats noted earlier, the main conclusions are that the FFC has made far-reaching changes  in  tax  devolu  on  that  will  move  the  country  toward  greater  ﬁscal  federalism, conferring more ﬁscal autonomy on the states. This will be enhanced by the FFC-induced impera  ve of having to reduce the scale of other central transfers to the states. In other words, states will now have greater autonomy both on the revenue and expenditure fronts. This,  of  course,  is  in  addi  on  to  the  beneﬁts  that  will  accrue  from  addressing  all  the governance and incen  ve problems that have arisen from programmes being dictated and managed   by   the   distant   central   government   rather   than   by   the   proximate   state governments.
To  be  sure,  there  will  be  transi  onal  challenges,  notably  how  the  Centre  will  meet  its mul  ple objecves given the shrunken ﬁscal envelope. But there will be oﬀse   ng beneﬁts: moving from CAS to FFC transfers will increase the overall progressivity of resource transfers to the states. Another is that overall public ﬁnances might actually improve by more than suggested by looking at the central government ﬁnances alone.
In sum, it is clear that the far-reaching recommenda  ons of the FFC, along with the crea  on
of  the  NITI  Aayog,  will  radically  alter  Centre-state  ﬁscal  rela  ons,  and  further  the government’s vision of coopera  ve and compe    ve federalism.
The  necessary,  indeed  vital,  encompassing  of  ci  es  and  other  local  bodies  within  the embrace of this new federalism is the next policy challenge, a change that we would like to see.

Q 77.B
Soil Health Card (Centrally Sponsored Scheme) for Integrated Plant Nutrient Management to improve soil fer  lity and produc  vity on a sustainable basis. 3rd statement is correct.
It aims to provide every farmer a Soil Health Card in a Mission mode. The card will carry crop wise  recommenda  ons of  nutrients/fer  lizers required  for farms, making it  possible  for farmers to improve produc  vity by using appropriate inputs.
Hence 1st statement is correct.
Every soil health card will be renewed a  er every three years.  Hence  2nd statement  is incorrect.
Central Government provides assistance to State Governments for se   ng up Soil Tes  ng Laboratories  for  issuing  Soil  Health  Cards to  farmers.  State  Governments  have  adopted innova  ve prac  ces like involvement of agricultural students, NGOs and private sector in soil tes  ng, determining average soil health of villages, etc., to issue Soil Health Cards. Hence 4th statement is correct. So op  on (b) is the correct answer.

Q 78.B
Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  is  an  important  management  tool  for  ensuring op  mal use of natural resources for sustainable development.

Q 82.B
OLED were in news as in Budget 2015-16 Basic customs duty was reduced from 10 % to nil to reduce the cost of raw materials.
OLED  panels  are  made  from  organic  (carbon  based)  materials   that  emit  light  when electricity is applied through them.
Since OLEDs do not  require  a backlight  and ﬁlters (unlike LCD displays), they are more eﬃcient, simpler to make, and much thinner.
OLEDs have a great picture quality - brilliant colors, fast response rate and a wide viewing angle.
Hence 1st and 2nd statements are correct; 3rd statement is incorrect and op  on (b) is the correct answer.

Q 83.B
Central Adop  on Resource Authority (CARA) is an autonomous body under the Ministry of
Women & Child Development, Government of India. Hence, 1st statement is incorrect.
CARA  primarily  deals  with  adop  on  of  orphan,  abandoned  and  surrendered  children through its associated /recognised adop  on agencies. It func  ons as the nodal body for adop  on of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate in-country and inter- country adop  ons. Hence, 2nd statement is correct.
CARA is designated as the Central Authority to deal with inter-country adop ons in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Conven  on on Inter-country Adop  on, 1993, ra  ﬁed by Government of India in 2003.
â€œInter-country  Adop  onâ€  means  adop  on  of  a  child  or  children  by persons  having status of Non-Resident  Indians  (NRIs) or Overseas Ci  zens of India (OCIs) or Persons of Indian Origins (PIOs) or Foreign Na  onals. Hence, 3rd statement is incorrect.
Changes  will  be  made  in  the  CARA  (will  be  made  a  statutory  body,  etc.)  through  the proposed Juvenile Jus  ce Bill, 2014 whenever it will get passed by both the houses of the Parliament.
Currently The Hindu Adop  on and Maintenance Act of 1956 governs adop  on by India ci  zens who are Hindus, Sikhs, Jains or Buddhists and does not permit adop  on of more than one child of the same sex. Adop  on by Indian ci  zens who are Muslims, Chris  ans, Parsis, Jews, Indian NRIs and foreign ci  zens are governed by the Guardian and Wards Act of
1890 under which the adop  ve parent is only the guardian of the child   ll its majority at 18 years of age.

Ar  cles 341 and 342 of the Cons  tuon deﬁnes to who would be SC and ST with respect to any state or UT. The Government has to prepare the list of OBCs.
Ar  cle 341 (1): The President may with respect to any State or Union Territory and where it is a State, a  er consulta  on with the Governor thereof, by public no  ﬁca  on specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes which shall for the purposes of this Cons  tu  on be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in rela  on to that State or Union Territory as the case may be.
Ar  cle 341 (2): Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes speciﬁed in a no  ﬁca  on issued under clause (1), any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe, but save as aforesaid a no  ﬁca  on issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent no  ﬁca  on
Ar  cle 342 has similar provisions for ST.
In the Cons  tu  on (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 (as amended from   me to   me), it has been men  oned that no person professing a religion diﬀerent from Hindu or Sikh religion can be deemed to be a member of Scheduled Castes. By later orders, persons converted into Buddhism (known as neo-Buddhists) are also members of the Scheduled Castes. There is, however, no religious bar for being treated as Scheduled Tribes

Q 85.B
The Arc  c is warming faster than the rest of the world. Recent research indicate that the Arc  c is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world. ï»¿Hence, only 1st statement is incorrect.
Why? Shiny ice and snow reﬂect a high propor  on of the sun's energy into space. As the Arc  c loses snow and ice, bare rock and water absorb more and more of the sunâ€™s energy, making it ever warmer. This is called the albedo eﬀect.
Carbon and methane has been locked in the permafrost and beneath the cold arc  c waters (in subsea permafrost) for millions of years. As the temperatures warm, these greenhouse gases are increasingly released into the atmosphere and cause further warming.

It was composed by Bankimchandra Cha  erjee and has an equal status as the Na  onal Anthem. Both Na  onal anthom Jangan Man and Na  onal song Vandematram were adopted on  24 January 1950.
Rajendra Prasad, who was presiding the Cons  tuent Assembly on 24 January 1950, made the following statement which was also adopted as the ﬁnal decision on the issue: â€œ...The composion  consis  ng  of  words  and  music  known  as  Jana  Gana  Mana  is  the  Na  onal Anthem of India, subject to such altera  ons as the Government may authorise as occasion arises, and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it. (Applause) I hope this will sa  sfy members.â€
It was translated into English by Aurobindo Ghosh.
The ﬁrst poli  cal occasion that it was sung was in 1896 session of INC not in 1911. The Na  onal Anthem was sung ﬁrst   me in 1911. ï»¿Hence, only 3rd statement incorrect. Rest all are correct.


Q 91.C
One   such   venerable   personality   is   Sant   Gadge   Baba   (1876-1956).   This   peripate  c mendicant-saint  from  Maharashtra,  one  of  the  greatest  modern-day  social  reformers  in India,  worked  for,  and  among,  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  (In  2010,  the  Maharashtra government launched a campaign for clean villages called the Sant Gadge Baba Gram Swachhata Abhiyan.) For 50 long years, from the   me he le    his home and family in 1905 un  l his death, he wandered from village to village, from town to town, with a broom in hand, his only other worldly possession being a small earthen pot he used to beg for food. ï»¿Hence, 1st statement incorrect. Rest all are correct.
Baba, an illiterate scholar who studied in the â€œUniversity of Lifeâ€, was a preacher par excellence. He sang bhajans composed by Bhak   saints, Sant Tukaram being his favourite. Cleanliness is godliness, he would retort when some people ridiculed him for mixing bhajans with broom-work. The ﬁrst thing he did a  er entering a village was to sweep the streets, especially the streets of â€œuntouchablesâ€™ quartersâ€, singing songs interspersed with his signature slogan, â€œGopala! Gopala! Devakinandan Gopala!â€ (Gopal is another name of Lord Krishna, son of Devaki.) People would join him and very soon the village would wear a clean look. Therea  er, usually a  er a common, contributory meal that people of all castes and communi  es ate together, he would gather the villagers for an interac  ve kirtan session of two-three hours at night.

Q 96.C
Integra  on is generally considered to be a process that evolves through a series of phases. Each of these phases or stages is described as:
Preferen  al Trade Agreement is area whose component countries enjoy trade preferences with each other in the area without necessarily covering the main items of trade between the signatory countries.
Free Trade Areas under this trade is conducted duty-free within the group of countries in the preference area, but each member is free to set its own customs tariﬀs on imports from non-member countries.
Customs  Union:  All members of  a free trade area impose the same customs tariﬀs on imports from non-member countries.
Common Market: Stage following the customs union, in which factors (labour and capital)
move around freely and common rules have been adopted for their regula  on.
Monetary Union: Use of a single currency or a reference currency based on a “basket” of the respec  ve na  onal currencies, with a common Central Bank and monetary policy. A monetary union is a stage following the establishment of a common market.
Poli  cal Union: Union of countries that share common environmental, social, labour and cultural policies; suprana  onal ins  tu  ons are provided for to regulate and “administer” the process of integra  on, foreign policy, etc.

Q 98.D
Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAANJHI) was launched in October , 2014 and at the na  onal level it is being  implemented by Ministry of Rural Development. Hence, 1st statement is incorrect.
The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, would  have three dis  nct features â€“ it would be (a) demand  driven  (b) inspired  by society  (c) based  on peopleâ€™s  par  cipa  on. The MP would  be  free  to  iden  fy  a  suitable  Gram  Panchayat  for  being  developed  as  Adarsh Gram, other than his/her own village or that of his/her spouse. Hence, 2nd statement is incorrect.
It aims at ins  lling certain values, such as peopleâ€™s par  cipa  on, Antyodaya, gender equality,   dignity   of   women,   social   jus  ce,  spirit   of   community   service,  cleanliness, eco-friendliness, maintaining ecological balance, peace and harmony, mutual coopera  on, self-reliance, local self-government, transparency and accountability in public life, etc. in the villages and their people so that they get transformed into models for others.
A Gram Panchayat would be the basic unit and not the Gram Sabha. Hence, 3rd statement is incorrect.
Primarily, the goal is to develop three Adarsh Grams by March 2019, of which one would be achieved by 2016. Therea  er, ﬁve such Adarsh Grams (one per year) will be selected and developed by 2024.
The MP will iden  fy one Gram Panchayat to be taken up immediately, and two others to be taken up a li  le later.
Lok Sabha MP has to choose a Gram Panchayat from within his/her cons  tuency and Rajya Sabha MP a Gram Panchayat from the rural area of a district of his/her choice in the State from which he/she is elected. Nominated MPs may choose a Gram Panchayat from the rural area of any district in the country.
In the case of urban cons  tuencies, (where there are no Gram Panchayats),  the MP will iden  fy a Gram Panchayat from a nearby rural cons  tuency.
