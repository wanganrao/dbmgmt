1. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements: 
1. A private member's bill is a bill presented by a Member of Parliament who is not elected but only nominated by the President of India.
2. Recently, a private member's bill has been passed in the Parliament of India for the first time in its history. 
Which of the statements given above is/are correct? 
a) 1 only 
b) 2 only 
c) Both 1 and 2 
d) Neither 1 nor 2 
Solution: D 
Justification: Statement 1: It is introduced by any member who is not a Minister. A bill introduced by a Minister is called as a public bill. 
Statement 2: Around 14 private member's bills have been passed since independence. 
http://www.prsindia.org/media/articles-citing-prs/only-14-private-members-bills-passed-since-independence-3759/

2. With reference to the difference between the culture of Rigvedic Aryans and Indus Valley people, which of the following statements is/are correct? 
1. Rigvedic Aryans used the coat of mail and helmet in warfare whereas the people of Indus Valley Civilization did not leave any evidence of using them.
2. Rigvedic Aryans knew gold, silver and copper whereas Indus Valley people knew only copper and iron.
3. Rigvedic Aryans had domesticated the horse whereas there is no evidence of Indus Valley people having been aware of this animal. 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 only 
b) 2 and 3 only 
c) 1 and 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: A 
Justification: Statement 2: The Indus valley people knew the use of copper, bronze, silver, gold but not iron. So, 2 is wrong. 
Statement 1: The Ramayana mentions chariots covered with leather. The Rig Vedic charioteers used varma (coats of mail) and sipra/sironastra (helmets). 
Equipped with asi (swords), hanas (arrows) and ilhianus (bows), the Kshatriyas on the chariots went to combat. 
Since statement 2 is wrong, given the options 1 must be correct. 
Statement 3: This is a disputed Statement. 
The Rig Veda mentions horse-drawn chariots with spoked wheels. 
But there is very little archaeological evidence of horses during the Harappan era and none at all earlier. The existence of the Harappan horse is a hotly disputed topic among archaeologists. 
Arguments: 
 Some claim that horse was NOT known.
 Among the numerous seals found in Harappa there is none which represent a horse, while other animals like the bull, buffalo, and goat are represented.
 Moreover, the cavalry (of horses) as an organised force can be traced only to the post vedic period, but not earlier. 
Arguments against: 
On the other hand, some scholars claim that the horse was widely domesticated and used in India in the area covered by the Indus-Sarasvati (or Harappan) Civilisation, but this evidence remains unsubstantiated. 
FINAL VIEW: But, based on the above, to say that "there is no evidence of Indus Valley people having been aware of this animal" is WRONG because there is no conclusive evidence that tells us whether they knew about horses, or whether they were aware of horses. We have insufficient evidence to claim anything about the connection between horses and Indus valley. 
Statement 3 is thus incorrect.

3. Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme' is sometimes mentioned in the news with reference to 
a) Certifying the skills acquired by construction workers through traditional channels. 
b) Enrolling the persons in Universities for distance learning programmes. 
c) Reserving some skilled jobs to rural and urban poor in some public sector undertakings. 
d) Certifying the skills acquired by trainees under the National Skill Development Programme. 
Solution: A 
Justification: Option A: The 'Recognition of Prior Learning' scheme - underway across construction sites in five states - to certify skills acquired by workers through traditional learning channels. 
 The project may be of particular relevance to a country where just 2 per cent of the workforce is certified as skilled.
 Most deemed to be outside the skilled category in India are those who have typically picked up a skill while on the job, without any formal degree to back this up. Option D is incorrect since it talks about trainees who are not fully skilled to get recognition of any prior learning. 
Individuals with prior learning experience or skills will also be assessed and certified under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), but this isn't applicable to trainees. So, D is incorrect. 
http://www.skilldevelopment.gov.in/pmkvy.html
Why: Aspirants cover core schemes and programmes but often miss covering ancillary and peripheral aspects. This was picked from 'between the lines' on the official website of PMKVY. Such ancillary questions can be expected even in the coming years. 

4. From the ecological point of view, which one of the following assumes importance in being a good link between the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats? 
a) Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve 
b) Nallamala Forest 
c) Nagarhole National Park 
d) Seshachalam Biosphere Reserve 
Solution: A 
Justification: Sathyamangalam forest range is a significant wildlife corridor in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve between the Western Ghats and the rest of the Eastern Ghats and a genetic link between the four other protected areas which it adjoins, including the Billigiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary, Sigur Plateau, Mudumalai National Park and Bandipur National Park. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathyamangalam_Wildlife_Sanctuary
Why: UPSC has the habit of picking up options from questions of its past year papers and asking new questions after improvising them. Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve can be found occasionally mentioned in CSP and CAPF papers; hence the question. 

5. One of the implications of equality in society is the absence of 
a) Privileges 
b) Restraints 
c) Competition 
d) Ideology 
Solution: A 
Justification: Article 18 of the constitution justifies this. Under Right to equality, A18 abolishes titular privileges (except military or academic) granted to citizens of India.

6. Consider the following statements in respect of Trade Related Analysis of Fauna and Flora in Commerce (TRAFFIC): 
1. TRAFFIC is a bureau under United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
2. The mission of TRAFFIC is to ensure that trade in wild plants and animals is not a threat to the conservation of nature. 
Which of the above statements is/are correct? 
a) 1 only 
b) 2 only 
c) Both 1 and 2 
d) Neither 1 nor 2 
Solution: B 
Justification: Statement 1: It is a NGO, not a bureau under UNEP. So, 1 is wrong. 
TRAFFIC is governed by the TRAFFIC Committee, a steering group composed of members of TRAFFIC's partner organizations, WWF and IUCN. 
Statement 2: It is working globally on Wildlife trade monitoring network. 
It specializes in investigating and analysing wildlife trade trends, patterns, impacts and drivers to provide the leading knowledge base on trade in wild animals and plants.

Solution: B 
Justification: The 42nd Amendment added new Directive Principles, viz Article 39A, Article 43A and Article 48A. 
Article 43A deals with 'Participation of workers in management of industries'. 
http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend42.htm

8. Which one of the following statements is correct? 
a) Rights are claims of the State against the citizens. 
b) Rights are privileges which are incorporated in the Constitution of a State. 
c) Rights are claims of the citizens against the State. 
d) Rights are privileges of a few citizens against the many. 
Solution: C 
Justification: Option C: The philosophy of rights is grounded in preventing the exploitation of the citizen by the state. So, essentially it is the claim of an individual against the state. 
Option B: This is wrong because rights are not privileges, they are the bare minimum for the formation of a democratic state. Also, the constitution abolishes the concept of special privileges.

9. Which of the following gives 'Global Gender Gap Index' ranking to the countries of the world? 
a) World Economic Forum 
b) UN Human Rights Council 
c) UN Women 
d) World Health Organization

Solution: B 
Justification: 
Statement 1 and 3: Sankirtana performers narrate the lives and deeds of Krishna through ritual singing, drumming and dancing of Manipur. So, both 1 and 3 are correct. 
Statement 2: Since drums are also used, statement 2 is incorrect. 
https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/sankirtana-ritual-singing-drumming-and-dancing-of-manipur-00843
Why: Sankirtana is one of the few important Indian heritages inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 

13. Who among the following was/were associated with the introduction of Ryotwari Settlement in India during the British rule? 
1. Lord Cornwallis
 2. Alexander Read
 3. Thomas Munro 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 only 
b) 1 and 3 only 
c) 2 and 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: C 
Justification: Statement 1 and 3: The Ryotwari system was devised by Capt. Alexander Read and Thomas Munro at the end of the 18th century. It was later introduced by Thomas Munro when he was governor (1820-27) of Madras. 
Statement 2: He is associated with the Cornwallis Code 1793 and could not have been the answer since his tenure preceded the ryotwari settlement regime. 
The principle behind Roytwari was the direct collection of the land revenue from each individual cultivator by government agents.

14. In the context of solving pollution problems, what is/are the advantage/advantages of bioremediation technique? 
1. It is a technique for cleaning up pollution by enhancing the same biodegradation process that occurs in nature.
2. Any contaminant with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead can be readily and completely treated by bioremediation using microorganisms.
3. Genetic engineering can be used to create microorganisms specifically designed for bioremediation. 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 only 
b) 2 and 3 only 
c) 1 and 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: C 
Justification: Statement 1: Bioremediation uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances. 
Statement 2: Always be cautious of extreme statements and words as we have repeatedly pointed out in our 2017 Prelims Test Series. Completely and readily (quickly) are such words here. 
Bio-remediation is a slow process, so. Heavy metals such as cadmium and lead are NOT readily absorbed or captured by microorganisms. UPSC had lifted this straight from Wikipedia. 
Statement 3: This will be a standard practice in the industry in coming years. For e.g. Alcanivorax, a bacteria with oil-eating abilities, can be used to create species that are much more capable of cleaning oil spills. 
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160509115556.htm 
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-clean-up-oil-spills/
Why: Expect around 6-8 standard conceptual questions on Eco-engineering every year. Bioremediation, biofuels, genetic engineering are some such standard concepts. 

15. The Trade Disputes Act of 1929 provided for 
a) the participation of workers in the management of industries. 
b) arbitrary powers to the management to quell industrial disputes. 
c) an intervention by the British Court in the event of a trade dispute. 
d) a system of tribunals and a ban on strikes. 
Solution: D 
Justification: Prior to the year 1947 (India's Independence), The Trade Disputes Act, 1929 used to settle industrial disputes. 
Tribunals: The main object of the 1929 Act was to make provisions for establishment of Courts of Inquiry and Boards of Conciliation with a view to investigate and settle trade disputes. 
Strikes: The Act prohibited strikes or lock-outs without notice in public utility services; it also made any strike or lock-out illegal which had any object other than the furtherance of a trade dispute within the trade or industry.

16. Local self-government can be best explained as an exercise in 
a) Federalism 
b) Democratic decentralisation 
c) Administrative delegation 
d) Direct democracy 
Solution: B 
Justification:
Option B: Decentralization and grass roots empowerment are the core guiding principles of local self-government as under 73rd and 74th constitutional amendment. For e.g. Gram Panchayats can sanction sanitation and welfare projects on their own. 
Option A: Local bodies are not federal entities as is the position of states in India. 
Option C: This isn't administrative delegation because local self-government bodies are political entities that are elected directly (or indirectly) by people and managed by their representatives. 
Option D: Since it involves election and indirect decision making by people's representatives, there can be no direct democracy (where all decisions are made directly by the people).

17. Consider the following statements:

19. At one of the places in India, if you stand on the seashore and watch the sea, you will find that the sea water recedes from the shore line a few kilometres and comes back to the shore, twice a day, and you can actually walk on the sea floor when the water recedes. This unique phenomenon is seen at 
a) Bhavnagar 
b) Bheemunipatnam 
c) Chandipur 
d) Nagapattinam 
Solution: C 
Justification: Chandipur-on-sea (Odisha) beach is unique in that the water recedes up to 5 kilometers during the ebb tide. 
You can 'literally' walk into the beach as the sea water recedes away from the shore line during the ebb tide (time period between the high tide and the low tide).

21. Due to some reasons, if there is a huge fall in the population of species of butterflies, what could be its likely consequence/consequences? 
1. Pollination of some plants could be adversely affected.
2. There could be a drastic increase in the fungal infections of some cultivated plants.
 3. It could lead to a fall in the population of some species of wasps, spiders and birds. 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 only 
b) 2 and 3 only 
c) 1 and 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: C 
Justification:
Statement 1: Bees and butterflies play a vital role in the pollination of plants and the production of crops by transporting pollen grains from one place to another. 
Statement 2: This is an absurd statement. 
Statement 3: These are some of the common predators of butterflies: wasps, ants, parasitic flies, birds, snakes, toads, rats etc. The decline in butterfly population would therefore adversely affect the food chain. http://www.thebutterflysite.com/what-eats-butterflies.shtml#sthash.PPoslJj4.dpuf

22. It is possible to produce algae based biofuels, but what is/are the likely limitation(s) of developing countries in promoting this industry? 
1. Production of algae based biofuels is possible in seas only and not on continents.
 2. Setting up and engineering the algae based biofuel production requires high level of expertise/technology until the construction is completed.
 3. Economically viable production necessitates the setting up of large scale facilities which may raise ecological and social concerns. 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 and 2 only 
b) 2 and 3 only 
c) 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: B 
Justification: Statement 1: Algaculture (farming algae) can be initiated on land unsuitable for agriculture or saline water or wastewater. So, 1 is wrong. 
Statement 2: Producing algae for bio-fuels (excluding simple seaweed production) requires significant capital investments, which may be a significant barrier in developing countries that have a weak investment climate. 
 Producing biofuels from algae is still in a pre-commercial state of technology development. Most production plants are therefore prototypes, and the development and engineering of such plants requires a high level of expertise. 
Statement 3: Using the land allotted to food crops to algal biofuel reduces the amount of food available for humans, resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced. This is an ecological as well as economic concern.

 25. In the context of mitigating the impending global warming due to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, which of the following can be the potential sites for carbon sequestration? 
1. Abandoned and uneconomic coal seams
2. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs
3. Subterranean deep saline formations 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 and 2 only 
b) 3 only 
c) 1 and 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: D 
Justification:
Geo-sequestration is a method that involves injecting carbon dioxide, generally in supercritical form, directly into underground geological formations. 
Statement 1: Unmineable coal seams can be used to store CO2 because the CO2 molecules attach to the surface of coal. 
Statement 2: CO2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to increase oil recovery. 
Other potential sites are gas fields, saline formations (statement 3), unmineable coal seams, and saline-filled basalt formations can act as storage sites. 
After sequestration, various physical (e.g., highly impermeable caprock) and geochemical trapping mechanisms prevent the CO2 from escaping to the surface.

26. The object of the Butler Committee of 1927 was to? 
a) Define the jurisdiction of the Central and Provincial Governments. 
b) Define the powers of the Secretary of State for India. 
c) Impose censorship on national press. 
d) Improve the relationship between the Government of India and the Indian States. 
Solution: D 
Justification: It was also known as the Indian states committee. 
Relations between the Indian Princes and the crown were not well defined because the extent of sovereignty of the Paramount power was not settled properly. 
The Indian states committee (under the Chairmanship of Harcourt Butler) in 1927 was appointed to investigate and clarify the relationship between the paramount power and the Princes.

27. The term 'Domestic Content Requirement' is sometimes seen in the news with reference to 
a) Developing solar power production in our country 
b) Granting licences to foreign T.V. channels in our country 
c) Exporting our food products to other countries 
d) Permitting foreign educational institutions to set up their campuses in our country 
Solution: A 
Justification: India's Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) favours Indian manufacturers of solar panels and cells in government procurement. This is known as DCR. 
 The WTO's Appellate Body has declared domestic content requirement (DCRs) in JNNSM as illegal.
 The US alleged that India's subsidies for the JNNSM discriminates against foreign suppliers of solar component.
 The primary point of conflict is with regards to government entering into long term electricity purchase contract with eligible solar power developers (SPDs), assuring them guaranteed prices for 25 years.

36. Which of the following statements is/are true of the Fundamental Duties of an Indian citizen?

2. They are correlative to legal duties. 
Select the correct answer using the code given below: 
a) 1 only 
b) 2 only 
c) Both 1 and 2 
d) Neither 1 nor 2 
Solution: C 
Justification: The language of this question is confusing and ambiguous, nonetheless a meaningful solution can be arrived at. 
Statement 1: While FDs can be enforced by legislative processes (for e.g. Environment Protection Act that helps enforce the individual duty of environment protection), the constitution explicitly does not enforce them via legal provisions or does not explicitly mention in Part IVA that there are legislative processes to enforce them. However, since the Parliament has enforced most fundamental duties already via a legislative process, we will consider this statement 1 as correct. 
Statement 2: It is not clear what UPSC means by 'legal duties', but for all practical purposes it can be considered as 'law of the land'. 
FDs are in sync with legal duties because what is illegal cannot be a fundamental duty, and what is a fundamental duty has also been made a legal duty (e.g. respecting women). 
Also, it is an Indian citizen's fundamental duty to abide by the constitutional laws (legal duties); this brings the correlation. Statement 2 is thus correct.

a) 1 and 2 only 
b) 3 only 
c) 1 and 3 only 
d) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: D 
Justification:
Statement 1: Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. 
No-till farming (also called zero tillage or direct drilling) is a way of growing crops or pasture from year to year without disturbing the soil through tillage. Zero tillage helps in soil moisture conservation. 
Statement 2: An infiltration problem often occurs in farms if the irrigation water does not enter the soil rapidly enough during a normal irrigation cycle. 
Gypsum helps in dissolution of the salt clay pan found in soils that hinder the percolation of water. This increases the efficiency of irrigation as less water is needed to irrigate the same soil. 
Adding gypsum to irrigation water further increases its infiltration rate. 
Statement 3: This reduces evaporation of farm soil water.

86. Right to vote and to be elected in India is a 
a) Fundamental Right 
b) Natural Right 
c) Constitutional Right 
d) Legal Right 
Solution: D 
Justification: There is dispute whether the answer should be C or D. 
Case for Option C: Logically the answer seems to be C because Article 326 of constitution grants adult suffrage which implies the right to vote. 
Moreover, a democratic constitution loses its essence if it does not provide for a right to vote as a constitutional right. 
It is true that Representation of People's Act also provides for a Right to Vote, but they may be considered qualifications (conditions) on the Right to Vote already granted by the constitution in A326. 
An analogy can be Child Labour Act or Bonded labour prohibition Act where these fundamental rights are separately enforced by law. So, the case for Option C looks strong. 
Option D: But, the Supreme Court is the final interpreter of the constitution and its view will prevail notwithstanding all arguments. 
The Supreme Court observed in PUCL vs. Union of India (2015), "No doubt, the right to vote is a statutory right but it is equally vital to recollect that this statutory right is the essence of democracy. Without this, democracy will fail to thrive. Therefore, even if the right to vote is statutory, the significance attached with the right is massive." 
Therefore, the answer to this question is D, not C.

b) 2 only 
c) Both 1 and 2

Solution: D 
Justification: Statement 1: It asks about India's Tax buoyancy, which the responsiveness of tax revenue mobilisation to GDP growth. 
It is calculated as a ratio of percentage growth in tax revenues to growth in nominal GDP for a given year. 
Tax is said to be buoyant (more than 1) if the gross tax revenues increase more than proportionately in response to a rise in GDP figures. If it is less than 1, it means tax revenues have not increased proportionately with GDP growth. 
The figure below shows variation in tax buoyancy from 2004-05 to 2015-16, which have been up and below 1 like a wave. So, statement 1 is wrong. 
The graph above shows tax revenues as a percentage of GDP from 2002 to 2014. 
https://thewire.in/32648/new-data-indicates-that-direct-tax-share-in-economy-is-at-decade-low/ 
Statement 2: Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP had increased rapidly in recession years (post 2008) due the fiscal stimulus given by the government and then declined due to the fiscal consolidation measures adopted. So, 2 is also wrong.

b) Powers have been clearly divided between the Centre and the States. 
c) The federating units have been given unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha. 
d) It is the result of an agreement among the federating units.
