1. Landfill gases are dominantly produced by evaporation of volatile organic compounds present in waste
2. Gases are produced in landfills due to the aerobic digestion by microbes.
3. Landfill gas is mainly carbon dioxide with remainder being mostly methane.
Which of the statement/s is/are correct about Landfill gas?
a) 1 and 2
b) Only 2
c) 1, 2 and 3
d) None
Answer: D
In chapter 16- Science-VI, there is mention about landfill. The hint of this question is taken from there.
One needs to prepare taking clue from basic books like this. Also, solid waste management is something very common in news.
Landfill gases are the result of three processes Evaporation of volatile organic compounds (e.g solvents), chemical reactions between waste components and microbial action , especially methanogenesis. The first two depend strongly on the nature of the waste . The dominant process in most landfills is the third process whereby anaerobic bacteria decompose organic waste to produce biogas which consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds Landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent methane, with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide.

4. Compost is a key ingredient in organic farming. Consider the following regarding composting
1. Composting can be aerobic or anaerobic
2. Composting organisms require carbon for oxidizing the oxygen in the decomposition process
Select the correct statement/s
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both
d) None
Answer: A
Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively Carbon -for energy; the microbial oxidation of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested levels.
High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.
Nitrogen - to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon.
High nitrogen materials tend to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.
Oxygen- for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.
Water - in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.
Please note that Carbon is a reducing agent and it will not oxidize oxygen but reduce it. Hence second statement is wrong.
During composting, organic matter breaks down into nitrogen and carbon, and when these two are balanced, you get compost. Too much nitrogen will make the matter rot; too much carbon makes the mix dry and inert.
Nitrogen comes from the green waste — vegetable and fruit peels, flowers, leftover food. Carbon comes from the brown waste — dry leaves that fall from trees, shredded cardboard, brown coconut shreds (not the shell).
While composting can be aerobic or anaerobic, the simplest way to compost involves air, introduced into the mix through vents in the composting bin and through an occasional stir.

d) India's economic backwardness was mainly due to negligence and natural disasters like 'famines'
Answer: D
Much of the economic backwardness can only be attributed to the land systems of the British going wrong.
· With Zamindari, Ryotwari and Mahalwari Systems turning out to be an engine of exploitation and oppression, the farmers lost bargaining power and there came to be a creation of Land Aristocracy with absolutely no technological improvements for improving the land or the way of cultivation.
· The uncertainty, over-assessment of land, textile woes and almost no provision for an appeal in the Court pushed the farmers on the receiving end of indebtedness and landlessness.
· The forcible growth of commercial crop (indigo and cotton) proved to be additionally hazardous along with the land becoming mortgageable and alienable- thereby, deteriorating the land and the soil quality and keeping the viscious cycle of poverty and dependency at its firm place.

9. Consider the statements about Orbital Decay

Select the correct statement/s
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both
d) None
Answer: B
In orbital mechanics, decay is a process that leads to gradual decrease of the distance between two orbiting bodies at their closest approach over many orbital periods.
These orbiting bodies can be a planet and its satellite, a star and any object orbiting it, or components of any binary system. The orbital decay can be caused by a multitude of mechanical, gravitational, and electromagnetic effects. For bodies in a low Earth orbit, the most significant effect is the atmospheric drag.
If left unchecked, the decay eventually results in termination of the orbit where the smaller object strikes the surface of the primary; or for objects where the primary has an atmosphere, it burns, explodes, or otherwise breaks up in its atmosphere; or for objects where the primary is a star, ends with incineration by the star's radiation (such as for comets), and so on.
Causes of Orbital Decay includes Atmospheric drag, Tidal effects, Mass concentration, light and thermal radiation and gravitational radiation

10. The term "Jizyah" during the period of mughals means

Gods of the Early Vedic period like Indra and Agni lost their importance. Prajapathi (the creator), Vishnu (the protector) and Rudra (the destroyer) became prominent during the Later Vedic period.
Sacrifices were still important and the rituals connected with them became more elaborate. The importance of prayers declined and that of sacrifices increased.
Priesthood became a profession and a hereditary one. The formulae for sacrifices were invented and elaborated by the priestly class.
Therefore, towards the end of this period there was a strong reaction against priestly domination and against sacrifices and rituals.

16. Consider the following
1. A graveyard orbit, also called a junk orbit or disposal orbit, is a super synchronous orbit that lies significantly below synchronous orbit, where spacecraft are intentionally placed at the end of their operational life.
2. A graveyard orbit is used when the change in velocity required to perform a de-orbit maneuver is too low
Select the correct statement/s
a) Only 1 
b) Only 2
c) Both
d) None
Answer: D
A graveyard orbit, also called a junk orbit or disposal orbit, is a super synchronous orbit that lies significantly above synchronous orbit, where spacecraft are intentionally placed at the end of their operational life. It is a measure performed in order to lower the probability of collisions with operational spacecraft and of the generation of additional space debris (known as Kessler syndrome).
A graveyard orbit is used when the change in velocity required to perform a de-orbit maneuver is too high.
For satellites in geostationary orbit and geosynchronous orbits, the graveyard orbit is a few hundred kilometers above the operational orbit. The transfer to a graveyard orbit above geostationary orbit requires the same amount of fuel that a satellite needs for approximately three months of station keeping. It also requires a reliable attitude control during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators try to perform such a maneuver at the end of the operational life, only one-third succeed in doing so.

51. Consider the statements
1. These orbits have an inclination near 90 degrees.
2. A satellite in a this orbit will pass over the equator at a different longitude on each of its orbits
3. It takes approximately 90 minutes for the satellite to complete one orbit.
Which is the most suited orbit as per the given explanation?
a) Polar
b) Sun Synchronous
c) Geostationary
d) Geosynchronous
Answer: A
Polar Orbits 
· The more correct term would be near polar orbits. These orbits have an inclination near 90 degrees.
· This allows the satellite to see virtually every part of the Earth as the Earth rotates underneath it.
· A satellite in a polar orbit will pass over the equator at a different longitude on each of its orbits · It takes approximately 90 minutes for the satellite to complete one orbit.
· These satellites have many uses o As measuring ozone concentrations in the stratosphere or measuring temperatures in the atmosphere.
o Earth Mapping and Observation o Reconnaissance o Weather satellites Sun Synchronous Orbits · These orbits allow a satellite to pass over a section of the Earth at the same time of day. Since there are 365 days in a year and
360 degrees in a circle, it means that the satellite has to shift its orbit by approximately one degree per day.
· These satellites orbit at an altitude between 700 to 800 km. These satellites use the fact since the Earth is not perfectly round (the Earth bulges in the center), the bulge near the equator will cause additional gravitational forces to act on the satellite. This causes the satellite's orbit to either proceed or recede.
· These orbits are used for satellites that need a constant amount of sunlight. Satellites that take pictures of the Earth would work best with bright sunlight, while satellites that measure long wave radiation would work best in complete darkness.
· These satellites are very important for military and remote sensing purposes.
Geosynchronous Orbits · Also known as geostationary orbits, satellites in these orbits circle the Earth at the same rate as the Earth spins. The Earth actually takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.09 seconds to make one full revolution.
· Geosynchronous orbits allow the satellite to observe almost a full hemisphere of the Earth. These satellites are used to study large scale phenomenon such as hurricanes, or cyclones.
· These orbits are also used for communication satellites. The disadvantage of this type of orbit is that since these satellites are very far away, they have poor resolution. The other disadvantage is that these satellites have trouble monitoring activities near the poles.
Difference between Geostationary and Geosynchronous Satellites · In geostationary, the orbit is circular and in equatorial plane thus the inclination is zero. So there is only one geostationary orbit.
Also, the angular velocities of these satellites are equal to angular velocity of the earth and hence these appear to be stationary with respect to earth all the time.
· On the other hand, in geosynchronous satellites, the orbit is neither circular nor equatorial and hence is inclined. It also has angular velocity equals to earths and period of revolution equals to rotation of earth as geostationary satellites. But there are many geosynchronous orbits unlike only one geostationary orbit.

2. Basically used for communication satellites
3. They are placed in an elliptical orbit.
4. Examples include GPS and Global Communication and Orblink Identify the type of orbit based on given statements?
a) Low Earth Orbit
b) Medium Earth Orbit
c) Geo Earth Orbit
d) None
Answer: B
LEO- Low Earth Orbit 
With Low Earth Orbit extending from 200 km to 1200 km it means that it is relatively low in altitude, although well above anything that a conventional aircraft can reach. However LEO is still very close to the Earth, especially when compared to other forms of satellite orbit including geostationary orbit.
LEO characteristics · Orbit times are much less than for many other forms of orbit.
· Less energy is expended placing the satellites in LEO than higher orbits.
· The lower orbit means the satellite and user are closer together and therefore path losses a less than for other orbits such as GEO.
· LEO satellites have shorter life spans than others · Some speed reduction may be experienced as a result of friction from the low, but measurable levels of gasses, especially at lower altitudes.
· Radiation levels are lower than experienced at higher altitudes.
Applications for LEO satellites A variety of different types of satellite use the LEO orbit levels. These include different types and applications including: . Communications satellites - some communications satellites including the Iridium phone system use LEO.
. Earth monitoring satellites use LEO as they are able to see the surface of the Earth more clearly as they are not so far away. They are also able to traverse the surface of the Earth.
. The International Space Station is in an LEO that varies between 320 km (199 miles) and 400 km (249 miles) above the Earth's surface.
Space debris in LEO · Apart from the general congestion experienced in Low Earth Orbit, the situation is made much worse by the general level of space debris that exists.
· There is a real and growing risk of collision and major damage - any collisions themselves are likely to create further space debris.
Medium Earth Orbits-MEO · They are in between LEO and GEO orbits. Operate about 8000-20000km above the earth that is lower than GEO and higher than LEO.
· Basically used for communication satellites · They are placed in an elliptical orbit.
· Examples include GPS and Global Communication and Orblink
