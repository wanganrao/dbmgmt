1. The amount of which of the following gases remains constant in the atmosphere as a whole?
a) Carbon dioxide
b) Water vapor
c) Methane
d) Both (b) and (c)
Answer: B 
All the gases mentioned in the option are variable gases. However, in the atmosphere as a whole, the total amount of water vapor remains nearly constant. Thus it's listing as a variable gas means variable in location, not variable in time.

2. Consider the following statements
1. Habitat is unique for a species while no two species in a habitat can have the same niche

3. Which of the following is also known as the cold zone of the atmosphere as it lacks a heat source?
a) Troposphere
b) Stratosphere 
c) Tropopause
d) Thermosphere
Answer: C 
All the layers of the atmosphere i.e. troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere are called as warm zones. The layers which separate these warm zones are cold simply because they lack any source of heat.

4. Primary succession is much more difficult than Secondary succession because
1. There are relatively very few places on earth that do not already have communities of organisms
2. It takes more time due to formation of soil in the process of Primary Succession
Select the correct code
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both
d) None
Answer: C 
Primary succession is much more difficult to observe than secondary succession because there are relatively very few places on earth that do not already have communities of organisms. Furthermore, primary succession takes a very long time as compared to secondary succession as the soil is to be formed during primary succession while secondary succession starts in an area where soil is already present.

11. Which of the following are the instruments or provisions available in the Indian constitution to ensure smooth functioning of the Parliament?
1. Question Hour
2. Zero Hour
3. Codified Parliamentary Privileges
4. The office of Whip
Select the correct answer using the given codes below:
a) 1, 2 and 3
b) 1 Only
c) None
d) 3 Only
Answer: C 
Question Hour - The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is slotted for this. During this time, the members ask questions and the ministers usually give answers. The questions are of three kinds, namely, starred, unstarred and short notice. Question hour is mentioned in the Rules of procedure of the House but not in the Constitution The zero hour starts immediately after the question hour and lasts until the agenda for the day ( ie ,regular business of the House) is taken up. In other words, the time gap between the question hour and the agenda is known as zero hour. It is an Indian innovation in the field of parliamentary procedures.  Unlike the question hour, the zero hour is not mentioned in the Rules of Procedure. Thus it is an informal device available to the members of the Parliament to raise matters without any prior notice.  Under the constitutional law and in the arena of Indian Parliament, the expression ' privilege and immunity' signifies certain special or exceptional rights of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha or its individual members which are generally accepted as necessary for the exercise of their constitutional functions.  Parliamentary Privileges help in smooth functioning of the Parliament, but there is no such thing as Codified Parliamentary Privileges . Though the demand for codification of privileges is not new and since early 1950's concerns have been raised, especially by the press, to remove the alleged arbitrariness prevailing in the exercise of privileges by the legislative bodies. Even the judiciary while deciding controversial matters relating to privileges, in its obiter dicta, has suggested such codification.  The office of 'whip' is mentioned neither in the Constitution of India nor in the Rules of the House nor in a Parliamentary Statute. It is based on the conventions of the parliamentary government. Every political party, whether ruling or Opposition has its own whip in the Parliament. He is appointed by the political party to serve as an assistant floor leader. He is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the attendance of his party members in large numbers and securing their support in favour of or against a particular issue. He regulates and monitors their behaviour in the Parliament. The members are supposed to follow the directives given by the whip. Otherwise, disciplinary action can be taken.

12. Consider the following statements.
1. In the night sky the twinkling effect is shown by stars and planets only. Not by moon and other natural or artificial satellites.
2. The twinkling effect is due to the multiple reflection of light as it travels through layers of different densities in the atmosphere.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 or 2
Answer: D 
The twinkling effect in the night sky is shown only by stars.  
As the light beam travels a long distance in atmosphere, it passes through different layers of changing densities. Because of this it is constantly refracting( not reflecting). As the the light beams constantly changes its path, it appears to a stationary observer that the star is blinking.

13. During sunrise and sunset, the sky appears reddish at the horizon. Which of the following phenomena are responsible for this?
1. Scattering
2. Total internal reflection
3. Transmission
Select the correct code:

16. Consider the following statements about Jupiter.
1. Jupiter, like Saturn and Uranus, has rings around it.
2. Jupiter has the fastest rotation amongst all the planets of the solar system, completing a rotation on its axis in less than 10 hours.
3. The latest probe to visit Jupiter will be Juno, expected to arrive in July 2016.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a) 1 only
b) 1 and 3
c) 2 and 3
d) All of the above
Answer: D 
Some facts about Jupiter Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets: It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly, giving it an oblate shape.  Jupiter orbits the Sun once every 11.8 Earth years: From our point of view on Earth, it appears to move slowly in the sky, taking months to move from one constellation to another.  Jupiter has a thin ring system: Its rings are composed mainly of dust particles ejected from some of Jupiter's smaller worlds during impacts from incoming comets and asteroids. The ring system begins some 92,000 kilometres above Jupiter's cloud tops and stretches out to more than 225,000 km from the planet. They are between 2,000 to 12,500 kilometres thick.  Eight spacecraft have visited Jupiter: Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, Ulysses, and New Horizons missions. The Juno mission is its way to Jupiter and will arrive in July 2016. Other future missions may focus on the Jovian moons Europa , Ganymede, and Callisto , and their subsurface oceans.

17. With regard to Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following
1. MSP is a form of market intervention by the Government of India
2. MSP is decided based on the recommendations of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee
3. MSP would ensure that the country's agricultural output responds to the changing needs of its consumers.
Select the correct answer using the given codes below:
a) 1 Only
b) 1 and 3
c) 1 and 2
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: B 
Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a form of market intervention by the Government of India to insure agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices. The minimum support prices are announced by the Government of India at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).  MSP is price fixed by Government of India to protect the producer - farmers - against excessive fall in price during bumper production years. The minimum support prices are a guarantee price for their produce from the Government. The major objectives are to support the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for public distribution. In case the market price for the commodity falls below the announced minimum price due to bumper production and glut in the market, government agencies purchase the entire quantity offered by the farmers at the announced minimum price.  MSP also ensures that the country's agricultural output responds to the changing needs of its consumers. This year, for instance, the prices of pulses have shot up sharply due to a sharp fall in production in the just concluded rabi season. The Centre has thus hiked the MSP of pulses by a larger margin than for paddy, to expand sowing of pulses in the coming year.

18. The International Astronomical Unit put Pluto in the category of a dwarf planet. Which of the following condition/s was/were not fulfilled by Pluto for it to be called a Planet?
1. A planet should have attained a spheroid shape due to rotation on its axis.
2. A planet should have a fixed elliptical orbit around the sun
3. A planet should have cleared its orbit from other smaller bodies like asteroids etc. because of its gravitational pull.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a) 1 only
b) 2 and 3
c) 3 only
d) 1 and 3
Answer: C 
According to International Astronomical Unit, three parameters have been chosen to decide whether an orbiting celestial body should be called a planet or not.
· A planet should have attained a spheroid shape due to rotation on its axis.
· A planet should have a fixed elliptical orbit around the sun · A planet should have cleared its orbit from other smaller bodies like asteroids etc. because of its gravitational pull.
Out of these three, Pluto does not fulfill the third criterion, i.e. it has not cleared its orbit. Hence, its status was changed from planet to a dwarf planet.
(Since New Horizon reached Pluto this year, a question can be expected from Pluto.)

20. Consider the following statements regarding adiabatic cooling of a rising air parcel
1.  The volume of the air parcel remains constant throughout.
2.  There is only a transfer of energy and not of matter.
Choose the correct from the following options:
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
Answer: D
Adiabatic cooling takes place when an air parcel rises up in the atmosphere. There is no addition or subtraction of heat energy. The volume keeps on increasing as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude. The increase in volume leads to wider spacing of air molecules which reduces the frequency of intermolecular collisions leading to decreased temperature.

a) 2, 3 and 4
b) 3 only
c) 1, 3 and 4
d) 3 and 4 only
Answer: C
Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts (AFSPA), are Acts of the Parliament of India that grant special powers to the Indian Armed Forces in what each act terms "disturbed areas". The Act was enacted the centre to counter insurgency.
In 1958 it was applied to the Seven Sister States in India's northeast. Another passed in 1983 and applied to Punjab and Chandigarh and was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force & from Tripura in 2015. Another such act was passed in 1990 and applied to Jammu and Kashmir.
According to the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), in an area that is proclaimed as "disturbed", an officer of the armed forces has powers to · After giving such due warning, Fire upon or use other kinds of force even if it causes death, against the person who is acting against law or order in the disturbed area for the maintenance of public order, · Destroy any arms dump, hide-outs, prepared or fortified position or shelter or training camp from which armed attacks are made by the armed volunteers or armed gangs or absconders wanted for any offence.
· To arrest without a warrant anyone who has committed cognizable offences or is reasonably suspected of having done so and may use force if needed for the arrest.
· To enter and search any premise in order to make such arrests, or to recover any person wrongfully restrained or any arms, ammunition or explosive substances and seize it.
· Stop and search any vehicle or vessel reasonably suspected to be carrying such person or weapons.
· Any person arrested and taken into custody under this Act shall be made present over to the officer in charge of the nearest police station with least possible delay, together with a report of the circumstances occasioning the arrest.
· Army officers have legal immunity for their actions. There can be no prosecution, suit or any other legal proceeding against anyone acting under that law. Nor is the government's judgment on why an area is found to be disturbed subject to judicial review.
· Protection of persons acting in good faith under this Act from prosecution, suit or other legal proceedings, except with the sanction of the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by this Act.

24. Consider the following statements
1. The planetary bodies in the outer Solar system are made of lighter elements.
2. The satellites of giant planets are composed mostly of ice.
3. All the satellites of Outer planets do not have tectonic activity.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a) 1 and 2
b) 1 and 3
c) 2 and 3
d) All of the above
Answer: A
The outer planets consist of planets beyond the asteroid belt. These planets do not have a solid surface and consists of gases (primarily hydrogen and some amount of helium with other gases in traces). These are lighter.
As the distance of these planets from the sun is significantly large, the temperature is very low. Because of this, the satellite of these planets consists of ice crystals.
Although the planets have a gaseous nature, their satellites have a solid crust in which the phenomenon of plate tectonics occurs.

Select the incorrect answer using the code given below.
a) None of the above.
b) 1 only
c) 1 and 2
d) 2 and 3
Answer: B
Our earth has only one satellite, that is, the moon. Its diameter is only one-quarter that of the earth. It appears so big because it is nearer to our planet than other celestial bodies. It is about 3 ,84,400 km away from us.
The moon moves around the earth in about 27 days. It takes exactly the same time to complete one spin. As a result, only one side of the moon is visible to us on the earth.

The Ministry of AYUSH was formed with effect from 9 November 2014 by elevation of the The Department of AYUSH.
The Department of Ayurveda , Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani , Siddha and Homoeopathy, abbreviated as AYUSH, is a governmental body in India purposed with developing education and research in ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine), yoga, naturopathy, unani , siddha , and homoeopathy, and other alternative medicine systems. The department was created in March 1995 as the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy (ISM&H). AYUSH received its current name in March 2003. That time it was operated under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
AYUSH has launched National AYUSH Mission (NAM) during 12th Plan for implementing through States/UTs. The basic objective of NAM is to promote AYUSH medical systems through cost effective AYUSH services, strengthening of educational systems, facilitate the enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda , Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy (ASU &H) drugs and sustainable availability of ASU & H raw-materials. It envisages flexibility of implementation of the programmes which will lead to substantial participation of the State Governments/UT. The NAM contemplates establishment of a National Mission as well as corresponding Missions in the State level. NAM is likely to improve significantly the Department's outreach in terms of planning, supervision and monitoring of the schemes.
With the increase in the number of lifestyle disorder, there has been a resurgence of interest in the AYUSH system of Medicine in the country and abroad. Knowing the potentials of AYUSH Government of India made it to be a critical part of NRHM.

30. Consider the following statements regarding the nature of wind:
1. Had there been no coriolis effect, wind direction would always have followed the pressure gradient with it's flow making right angle with the isobars.
2. Had there been no friction, wind direction would have followed a path parallel to the isobars.
Choose the correct statements:
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
Answer: C
The movement of air is a function of pressure gradient, coriolis effect and friction. In the absence of coriolis effect , there won't be any deflection in wind direction and it will follow the pressure gradient at right angle with the isobars. In absence of friction, there is a balance between pressure gradient and coriolis effect which gives rise to a wind that moves parallel to the isobars. In fact such movement is possible in the upper atmosphere where the effect of friction is negligible. Wind moves parallel to the isobars and is called a geostrophic wind.

31. Which of the followings are correct about Nitrogen dioxide?
1. It is a lung irritant and can lead to severe respiratory disorders in children.
2. It can damage leaves of plants and can retard the rate of Photosynthesis.
3. The red haze during heavy traffic is due to the presence of NO  in air.
4. It is harmful to various textile fibers and metals.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a) All of the above 
b) 1 and 3
c) 1 and 2
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: A
The irritant red haze in the traffic and congested places is due to oxides of nitrogen. Higher concentrations of NO2 damage the leaves of plants and retard the rate of photosynthesis. Nitrogen dioxide is a lung irritant that can lead to an acute respiratory disease in children. It is toxic to living tissues also. Nitrogen dioxide is also harmful to various textile fibres and metals.
Dinitrogen and dioxygen are the main constituents of air. These gases do not react with each other at a normal temperature. At high altitudes when lightning strikes, they combine to form oxides of nitrogen.
NO2 is oxidised to nitrate ion, NO3 - which is washed into soil, where it serves as a fertilizer. In an automobile engine, (at high temperature) when fossil fuel is burnt, dinitrogen and dioxygen combine to yield significant quantities of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) as given below: N2 (g) + O2 (g) --> 1483K ? 2NO( g) NO reacts instantly with oxygen to give NO2 2NO (g) + O2 (g) ? 2NO2 (g) Rate of production of NO2 is faster when nitric oxide reacts with ozone in the stratosphere.
NO (g) + O3 (g) ? NO2 (g) + O2 (g)

34. The characteristics of photochemical smog are:
1. It is oxidizing in nature.
2. It consists of Ozone, Nitrogen Oxides, Sulphur Oxides and Hydrocarbons.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
a) None of the above
b) both 1 and 2
c) only 1
d) only 2 
Answer: C
The word smog is derived from smoke and fog. This is the most common example of air pollution that occurs in many cities throughout the world. There are two types of smog: · Classical smog occurs in cool humid climate. It is a mixture of smoke, fog and sulphur dioxide.
Chemically it is a reducing mixture and so it is also called as reducing smog.
· Photochemical smog occurs in warm, dry and sunny climate. The main components of the photochemical smog result from the action of sunlight on unsaturated hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides produced by automobiles and factories. Photochemical smog has high concentration of oxidising agents and is, therefore, called as oxidising smog.
The point to be noted is that, in photochemical smog, there is no oxide of SULPHUR.

35. Consider the following statements regarding trade winds:

Choose the wrong option from the following options:
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
Answer: C
There are exceptions to the consistency and direction of the trade winds, especially over the Indian Ocean where seasonal reversal in the form of monsoon takes place annually. Moreover, trade winds bring rain only to those areas where there is a topographical barrier. Low lying islands remain virtually rain less.

b) It was a peace treaty between India and Pakistan seeking to reverse the consequences of the 1971 war
c) It was as a treaty concerning the status of Tibet negotiated by representatives of the Republic of China, Tibet and India
d) None
Answer: D
Simla Accord (1914) was as a treaty concerning the status of Tibet negotiated by representatives of the Republic of China, Tibet and the United Kingdom in Simla in 1913 and 1914.
The Simla Agreement signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan on 2nd July 1972 was much more than a peace treaty seeking to reverse the consequences of the 1971 war (i.e. to bring about withdrawals of troops and an exchange of PoWs ). It was a comprehensive blue print for good neighbourly relations between India and Pakistan.
Shillong Accord of 1975 was an agreement signed between the Government of and Nagaland's underground government (or Naga Federal government), to accept- · supremacy of Constitution of India without condition · surrender their arms and renounce their demand for the secession of Nagaland from India · representatives of the underground organisations should have reasonable time to formulate other issues for discussion for final settlement.

38. Which of the following is incorrect regarding Eutrophication ? .
a) It is caused due to excessive algal bloom in ponds and lakes.
b) Some algae may release toxins which are harmful for other aquatic organisms.
c) It decreases the Biochemical Oxygen Demand of the water body.
d) Algal bloom may cover the water surface blocking all the sunlight required for photosynthesis by underwater plants, leading to their death.
Answer: C
Eutrophication is when the environment becomes enriched with nutrients. This can be a problem in marine habitats such as lakes as it can cause algal blooms.
. Fertilisers are often used in farming, sometimes these fertilizers run-off into nearby water causing an increase in nutrient levels.
. This causes phytoplankton to grow and reproduce more rapidly, resulting in algal blooms.
. This bloom of algae disrupts normal ecosystem functioning and causes many problems.
. The algae may use up all the oxygen in the water i.e. increases the BOD( rather than deceasing), leaving none for other marine life. This results in the death of many aquatic organisms such as fish, which need the oxygen in the water to live.
. The bloom of algae may also block sunlight from photosynthetic marine plants under the water surface.
. Some algae even produce toxins that are harmful to higher forms of life. This can cause problems along the food chain and affect any animal that feeds on them.

45. Bio-accumulating compounds do not have which of the following characteristics?
1. They are fat soluble.
2. High resistance to degradation by biological means.
3. Rate of accumulation is lower than the rate of removal.
4. Highly soluble in water.
Select the answer using the code given below.
a) 1 and 2
b) 3 and 4
c) 1 and 3
d) 2 and 4
Answer: B
Bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances, such as pesticides, or other chemicals in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a toxic substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost.
These compounds are stored in the body's fat, and when the fatty tissues are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning. They are generally highly resistant to biological decay and are not easily soluble in water, hence they do not get out of the system of an organism through excreta.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was established in January 2009 and is part of the Planning Commission of India. UIDAI aims to provide a unique 12 digit ID number to all residents (and not citizens alone) in India on a voluntary basis. The number will be known as AADHAAR. The UIDAI will own and operate a Unique Identification Number database which will contain biometric and demographic data of citizens.
It was by an executive order of January 28, 2009 that the UIDAI was created. An executive action could not circumvent Parliament. National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 is yet to receive approval of Parliament before being declared a law. Hence it is a non-statutory body.
Objective: The scheme has been promoted by the UIDAI as enabling a number of social benefits including improving the public distribution system, enabling financial inclusion, and improving the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). Despite these benefits, the UIDAI only guarantees identity, and does not guarantee rights, benefits or entitlement Source: https://uidai.gov.in/about-uidai.html http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/aadhaar-has-no-legal-base.html

50. The first organisms to take hold in a hostile environment are called:
a) Climax species
b) Seral species
c) First plants
d) Pioneer species
Answer: D
The species that invade a bare area are called pioneer species. In primary succession on rocks these are usually lichens which are able to secrete acids to dissolve rock, helping in weathering and soil formation. These later pave way to some very small plants like bryophytes, which are able to take hold in the small amount of soil. They are, with time, succeeded by bigger plants, and after several more stages, ultimately a stable climax forest community is formed. The climax community remains stable as long as the environment remains unchanged.

This portion of the blasted material continued to orbit the earth.

54. Which of the following is not correct about mangrove forests?
1. They can survive in saline water.
2. Their roots are not exposed during low tide.
3. Some species have developed wide buttress roots.
4. Leaves are adapted to expel large amount of water.
Select the answer using the code given below.
a) 1 and 3
b) 1 and 2
c) 2 and 4
d) 2, 3 and 4
Answer: C
Mangroves have had to physically adapt their leaves, their roots and their reproductive methods in order to survive in a harsh, dynamic environment of soft, low oxygen soils and varying salinity.
Leaf adaptations to saline conditions · Many mangrove species, such as the Grey Mangrove and the River Mangrove (common species along the Redlands coast), have leaves with glands that excrete salt.
· Some species such as the Grey Mangrove can also tolerate the storage of large amounts of salt in their leaves - which are discarded when the salt load is too high.
· Mangroves can also restrict the opening of their stomata (these are small pores through which carbon dioxide and water vapour are exchanged during photosynthesis). This allows the mangrove to conserve its fresh water, an ability vital to its survival in a saline environment.
· Mangroves are able to turn their leaves to reduce the surface area of the leaf exposed to the hot sun.
This enables them to reduce water loss through evaporation.
Root adaptations to soft, saline, low oxygen soils · A distinctive feature of mangroves is their far-reaching, exposed roots. While these roots come in many different shapes and sizes, they all perform an important function - structural support in the soft soils.
· Some species of mangroves have pneumataphores , which are above-ground roots. These are filled with spongy tissue and peppered with small holes that offer structural support and allow oxygen to be transferred to the roots trapped below ground in the anaerobic (low oxygen) soils.
· The roots of many mangrove species are also adapted to stop the intake of a lot of the salt from the water before it reaches the plant.
Reproductive adaptations to tidal environment · Some mangrove species have evolved to produce seeds that float. The tide acts as the method of dispersal to avoid crowding of young plants.
· Other mangrove species are viviparous. They retain their seeds until after it has germinated and a long, cylindrical propagule has formed. When it has matured to this stage, the parent tree drops it into the water, where it remains dormant until it finds the soil and is able to put out roots.

67. Which of the following d oesn't aid the formation of katabatic winds?
a) Gravity
b) Convection
c) Radiation cooling
d) Funneling through a narrow valley
Answer: B
A katabatic wind originates from radiational cooling of air atop a plateau, a mountain, glacier, or even a hill. Since the density of air is inversely proportional to temperature , the air will flow downwards, warming adiabatically as it descends. The temperature of the wind depends on the temperature in the source region and the amount of descent. In the case of the Santa Ana, for example, the wind can (but does not always) become hot by the time it reaches sea level. In the case of Antarctica, by contrast, the wind is still intensely cold.
As you know c onvection has no role to play in the formation of katabatic winds.

c) Degradation of detritus into simpler inorganic compounds by the action of bacterial and fungal enzymes.
d) Removal of water content from the organic material in the presence of sunlight.
Answer: C
Detritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles. This process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, water soluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism.
