1. Consider the following statements regarding Mangroves and its ability to cope with salt
1. The first line of defense for many mangroves is to prevent much of the salt from entering by filtering it out at root level. Some species can exclude more than 90 percent of salt in seawaters
2. The leaves of many mangroves have special salt glands, which are among the most active salt-secreting systems known
3. Another method of coping with salt is to concentrate it in bark or in older leaves which carry it with them when they drop.
Select the correct statement[s]
a) 1, 2 and 3
b) 1 and 3
c) 2 and 3
d) 1 and 2
Answer: A 
 How do Mangroves cope with salt? Coping with salt The first line of defense for many mangroves is to prevent much of the salt from entering by filtering it out at root level. Some species can exclude more than 90 percent of salt in seawaters (Rhizophora, Ceriops, Bruguiera species are all 'salt-excluders'.) Another method is the retention of water in the leaves giving rise to leaf succulence in many species, viz., Sonneratia apetala, S. alba, Lumnitzera recemosa, Salvadora persica etc. These species show remarkably high concentration of salts stored in their tissue. To avoid the toxic effects of salts, these plants absorb a large quantity of water for dilution of salt.
The leaves of many mangroves have special salt glands, which are among the most active salt-secreting systems known. It is quite possible to see and/or taste the salt on the leaf surfaces of species, which choose this method. (Examples of 'salt-secretors' include Avicennia, Sonneratia and Acanthus).
Fourth method of coping with salt is to concentrate it in bark or in older leaves which carry it with them when they drop. (Lumnitzera, Avicennia, Ceriops and Sonneratia species all use this)

2. Consider the following statements
a) Oceans of the world have finely demarcated natural boundaries.  
b) Oceans of the world are all connected and merge so naturally that it is impossible to demarcate them.
c) Oceans of the world are connected but there is no intermixing of water.
d) Geographers have divided the world into seven oceans. Which of the above statement is correct?
Answer: B 
 The oceans are confined to the great depressions of the earth's outer layer. The oceans, unlike the continents, merge so naturally into one another that it is hard to demarcate them. The geographers have divided the oceanic part of the earth into five oceans, namely the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, Southern ocean and the Arctic. The various seas, bays, gulfs and other inlets are parts of these five large oceans.

3. Consider the following regarding calcareous oozes
1. Globigerina and pteropod are types of calcareous oozes
2. They are found below 5000m depth.
Which of the above statements is/are true?
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
Answer: A 
 Calcareous ooze is ooze that is composed of at least 30% of the calcareous microscopic shells—also known as tests—of foraminifera, globigerina, coccolithophores, and pteropods. This is the most common pelagic sediment by area, covering 48% of the world ocean's floor. This type of ooze accumulates on the ocean floor at depths above the carbonate compensation depth. It accumulates more rapidly than any other pelagic sediment type.
Calcareous oozes are soluble in highly saline water. With high pressure and salinity the calcareous oozes are seldom found below 4000m. Very rarely they are found up to 5000m.

4. Consider the following statements w.r.t Corals
1. Corals can reproduce either sexually or asexually
2. The partnership between corals and their zooxanthellae is called symbiosis
3. The Coral Triangle, the global centre of marine biodiversity, is an area spanning Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands.
Select the correct statement[s]
a) 1 and 3
b) 2 and 3
c) 1 and 2
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Corals have multiple reproductive strategies - they can be male or female or both, and can reproduce either asexually or sexually. Asexual reproduction is important for increasing the size of the colony, and sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity and starts new colonies that can be far from the parents.
Corals also have to worry about competitors. They use the same nematocysts that catch their food to sting other encroaching corals and keep them at bay. Seaweeds are a particularly dangerous competitor, as they typically grow much faster than corals and may contain nasty chemicals that injure the coral as well.
Corals do not have to only rely on themselves for their defenses because mutualisms (beneficial relationships) abound on coral reefs. The partnership between corals and their zooxanthellae is one of many examples of symbiosis, where different species live together and help each other.
The Coral Triangle, the global centre of marine biodiversity, is a 6 million km2 area spanning Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands.
Within this nursery of the seas live 76% of the world's coral species, 6 of the world's 7 marine turtle species, and at least 2,228 reef fish species.

5. Consider the following statements
1. Ocean topography is smooth, contrary to Continental topography.
2. Ocean relief is rugged with different topography like that of a continent.
3. Ocean relief cannot be explained with plate tectonics.
4. Only depositional landforms are found in oceans and not erosional .
Which of the above are incorrect?  
a) 1 only
b) 1 and 3
c) 1,2 and 3
d) 1,3 and 4
Answer: D
 A major portion of the ocean floor is found between 3-6 km below the sea level. The 'land' under the waters of the oceans, that is, the ocean floor exhibits complex and varied features as those observed over the land. The floors of the oceans are rugged with the world's largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains. These features are formed, like those of the continents, by the factors of tectonic, volcanic and depositional processes. Erosive landforms are also found on the ocean floor carved by ocean currents, undercurrents etc.

8. Consider the following w.r.t Convention of Biodiversity (CBD)
1. International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) is celebrated on 22 nd May
2. The theme of IDB-2015 was "Island Biodiversity"
3. CEPA Fair -the Fair on experiences and best practices in Communication, Education and Public Awareness (CEPA is related to Biological Diversity and its Protocols.
Select the correct statement[s]
a) Only 3
b) 1 and 2
c) 1 and 3
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: C
 CEPA Fair -the Fair on experiences and best practices in Communication, Education and Public Awareness (CEPA)- will be held during the Meetings of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Protocols, from 4 to 17 December 2016, in Cancun, Mexico.
 The CEPA Fair provides a unique opportunity for Parties and organizations to highlight their work and their contribution to the implementation of the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The United Nations has proclaimed May 22: The International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues International Day for Biological Diversity 2015: "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development" This year's theme reflects the importance of efforts made at all levels to establish a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of the United Nations Post-2015 Development Agenda for the period of 2015-2030 and the relevance of biodiversity for the achievement of sustainable development.

9.  Which of the following statements is not correct?
a) Mid oceanic ridge is found at diverging oceanic plate boundaries.
b) Oceanic crust at mid oceanic ridge is younger than the crust near the trenches.
c) Sea mounts are stray sub marine mountains of volcanic origin.
d) Mid oceanic ridges are formed above Benioff zone.
Answer: D
 The zone of subduction is also called the Benioff zone. Ocean trenches are formed near benioff zone.
And subducted crust melts and erupts as lava forming volcanic islands. Mid oceanic ridges are found at diverging boundaries where there is no subduction.
As the lava oozes out at diverging boundary it keep on creating new crust. The lava continuously rises and solidifies forming a continuous chain of mountain called mid oceanic ridge. The older crust is pushes away from the ridge . This is explained by the theory of sea floor spreading. Hence crust at ridge is much younger than the crust found at oceanic trench.

11. Consider the following statements.  
a) Sediments found at continental shelf are terrigenous in nature.
b) Maximum volume of sediments is found on the abyssal plane.
c) Tektites are small glassy particles having their origin in space.
d) Diatom is a kind of silicious ooze. Which of the above statement is incorrect?
Answer: B
 Maximum volume of sediments is found of the continental slopes-41% Region Percent of Ocean Area Percent of Total Volume of Marine Sediments Average Thickness Continental shelves 9% 15% 2.5 km (1.6 mi) Continental slopes 6% 41% 9 km (5.6 mi) Continental rises 6% 31% 8 km (5 mi) Deep-ocean floor 78% 13% 0.6 km (0.4 mi)

12. Consider the following statements regarding Continental Shelf:
1. It is a part of Continental crust extended in the ocean.
2. They are often marked with submarine canyons.
3. It has an average gradient of 1 o or less.
4. Continental shelves are largest on the west coast of Sumatra and chile .
Which of the statements are correct?
a) 1,2 and 3
b) 1 and 2 
c) 3 and 4
d) All of the above
Answer: A
 The continental shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs. It is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of 1° or even less. The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called the shelf break.The width of the continental shelves vary from one ocean to another. The average width of continental shelves is about 80 km. The shelves are almost absent or very narrow along some of the margins like the coasts of Chile, the west coast of Sumatra, etc.
On the contrary, the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean, the largest in the world, stretches to 1,500 km in width. The depth of the shelves also varies. It may be as shallow as 30 m in some areas while in some areas it is as deep as 600 m.
The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, wind, from the land and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves, become the source of fossil fuels.

14. Select the incorrect statement
a) The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) was established in 2013 to implement India's Biological Diversity Act (2002).
b) The NBA is a Statutory and Autonomous Body
c) It performs the function of regulatory as well as advisory body for GoI 
d) Its functions includes conservation and development of area of importance from the view point of biological diversity by declaring them as biological diversity heritage sites
Answer: A
 The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) was established in 2003 to implement India's Biological Diversity Act (2002). The NBA is a Statutory, Autonomous Body and it performs facilitative, regulatory and advisory function for the Government of India on issues of conservation, sustainable use of biological resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources.
The main objectives of NBA are: To regulate access to biological resources of the country to conserve and sustainable use of biological diversity.
To respect and protect the knowledge of local communities related to biodiversity To secure sharing of benefits with the local people as conservers of biological resources, holders of knowledge and information relating to the use of biological resources.
Conservation and development of area of importance from the view point of biological diversity by declaring them as biological diversity heritage sites.
Protection and rehabilitation of threatened species, involvement of institutions of state government in the broad scheme of implementation of the Biological Diversity Act through constitution of committees.

15. Consider the following statements:
1. Thalwege of a river channel is almost straight in youth stage.
2. Meanders are formed when there is simultaneous deposition and erosion on opposite banks of the river.
3. Plunge pools are formed in youth stage by the impact of waterfalls.
4. India rivers form Arcuate Deltas.
Which of the above statements are correct?
a) 2 and 3
b) 1 and 4
c) All of the above
d) None of the above
Answer: C
 Thalwege is an imaginary line joining the deepest points of the river channel. The sinusoidal nature of river increases as the river goes from youth to old stage. During youth stage the flow of channel is very swift and less zig-zag, hence thalwege is relatively very straight in youth stage.
Meanders are formed when there is simultaneous deposition and erosion on opposite banks of the river.
The bank where deposition takes place is called point bar and has gradual gradient in the river. The bank where erosion is taking place is called cliff bank and gradient is very steep.
Plunge pools are formed when water from a considerable height hits the floor. They are formed below the water falls.
When the density of the sediments of river water is higher than the density of the sea, the sediments are readily deposited at the mouth of the river. This condition is called hyperpycnal. In this case triangular delta is formed which is called arcuate delta. Indian rivers form this type of deltas eg Sundarbans, Krishna Godavari delta etc.
The other two types of delta are - Cuspate delta (river Tiber) and Birdfoot delta( rive Mississippi)

16. Consider the following statements regarding ocean trenches:
1. They are found at converging plate boundaries.
2. They are found along volcanic island chains.
3. As photosynthesis is not possible, No life form is found in them.
4. Due to high pressure and very low temperature, the water is in frozen state.
Choose the correct statements
a) 1 only
b) 1 and 2
c) 1, 2 and 3
d) All of the above. Correct
Answer: B
 These areas are the deepest parts of the oceans. The trenches are relatively steep sided, narrow basins.
They are some 3-5 km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor. They occur at the bases of continental slopes and along island arcs and are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes. That is why they are very significant in the study of plate movements. As many as 57 deeps have been explored so far; of which 32 are in the Pacific Ocean; 19 in the Atlantic Ocean and 6 in the Indian Ocean.
Ocean trenches are some of the most hostile habitats on Earth. Pressure is more than 1,000 times that on the surface, and the water  temperature is just above freezing.  Perhaps most importantly, no sunlight penetrates the deepest ocean trenches, making photosynthesis impossible.
Organisms that live in ocean trenches have evolved with unusual adaptations to thrive in these cold, dark  canyons. Their behavior is a test of the so-called "visual interaction hypothesis," which states that the greater an organism's visibility, the more energy it must expend to catch prey or repel predators. In general, life in dark ocean trenches is isolated and slow-moving.

17.  Consider the following statements:
1. Submarine canyons are steep sided deep valleys formed due to erosion of Abyssal plain.
2. Seamounts are underwater submarine mountains which do not reach the ocean surface.
3. Guyots are the fat topped sea mountains.
4. Deep trenches are an extension of Sub Marine Canyons
Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?
a) 1 only
b) 2 and 3
c) 1 and 4
d) All of the above  
Answer: C
 It is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are volcanic in origin. These can be 3,000-4,500 m tall. The Emperor seamount, an extension of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean, is a good example.
It is a flat topped seamount. They show evidences of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat topped submerged mountains. It is estimated that more than 10,000 seamounts and guyots exist in the Pacific Ocean alone.
These are deep valleys, some comparable to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado river. They are sometimes found cutting across the continental shelves and slopes, often extending from the mouths of large rivers. The Hudson Canyon is the best known submarine canyon in the world. They do not cut the abyssal plain.
Submarine canyons and ocean trenches are two different phenomenons which are not related to each other.

19. Which of the following is incorrect as per National Biodiversity Authority under Biological Diversity Act of India?
a) The Act covers foreigners, non-resident Indians, body corporate, association or organization that is either not incorporated in India or incorporated in India with non-Indian participation in its share capital or management.  
b) Indians and Indian institutions do not require the approval of the National Biodiversity Authority when they engage in the access/use of biological resources and associated knowledge occurring in India for commercial or research purposes or for the purposes of bio-survey or bio- utilisation
c) Any application for IPR based on biological resources should be approved by NBA
d) The Act includes Indian biological resources that are normally traded as commodities.
Answer: D
 The Act covers foreigners, non-resident Indians, body corporate, association or organization that is either not incorporated in India or incorporated in India with non-Indian participation in its share capital or management. These individuals or entities require the approval of the National Biodiversity Authority when they access/ use biological resources and associated knowledge occurring in India for commercial or research purposes or for the purposes of bio-survey or bio-utilisation.
Indians and Indian institutions do not require the approval of the National Biodiversity Authority when they engage in the above mentioned activities. However they would need to inform the State Biodiversity Boards prior to undertaking any research with the intent of commercialization. Any application for IPR based on biological resources should be approved by NBA.
The Act excludes Indian biological resources that are normally traded as commodities. Such exemption holds only so far the biological resources are used as commodities and for no other purpose. The Act also excludes traditional uses of Indian biological resources and associated knowledge and when they are used in collaborative research projects between Indian and foreign institutions with the approval of the central government

20. Instead of equator, the maximum surface temperature of ocean water is found in tropical zones (30 o N and S latitude). Which of the following is the most appropriate explanation for this?
a) Sun is directly overhead over the tropics.
b) Hot winds from the deserts blow towards the oceans heating the surface water.
c) Vegetation at equator reflects more light than the tropical vegetation.
d) Due to low pressure the equatorial area is covered with clouds throughout the year blocking the direct sunlight.
Answer: D 
Due to low pressure there is atmospheric instability at equator causing formation of clouds. The cloud cover blocks the direct sunlight. So even though sun is directly overhead the equator, the surface temperature of water is recorded higher at the tropics.
At around 30 o north and south, there is sub tropical high pressure belt. Due to this there is clear sky hence surface water is heated by the sun.

22. Which of the following statements is incorrect?  
a) Pygmy hog is critically endangered species of a pig found in the grasslands of Madhya Pradesh.
b) Western Ghats are Ecological hotspot of India.
c) Nilgiri is a biosphere reserve
d) Kanchendzonga is a biosphere reserve found in Sikkim.
Answer: A
 The pygmy hog is a critically endangered suid, previously spread across India, Nepal, and Bhutan, but now only found in Assam. The current world population is about 150 individuals or fewer. Recent conservation measures have improved the prospects of survival in the wild of this critically endangered species. There are two ecological hotspots found in India- Western Ghats and Eastern Himalyas. There are eighteen Biological reserves in India. Nilgiri and Kanchendzonga are amongst them.

23. In what type of rocks Exfoliation dombs are best developed?
a) Granite
b) Basalt
c) Limestone
d) Sand Stone
Answer: A
 Exfoliation, separation of successive thin shells, or spalls, from massive rock such as granite or basalt; it is common in regions that have moderate rainfall. The thickness of individual sheet or plate may be from a few millimetres to a few metres.
Some geologists believe that exfoliation results when rocks formed at depth are exposed at the ground surface; the previous compressional forces would decrease and thus allow the rock to expand by fracturing parallel to the surface. Quite often, however, the fractures are not parallel to the ground surface, and this circumstance is taken as an indication of some other method of formation.
Exfoliation domes are best developed in granitic rock. Yosemite National Park has exceptional examples of exfoliation domes. Idaho has good examples in the Quiet City of Rocks near Oakley as well as in many parts of the granitic Idaho Batholith. In fact, these characteristic rounded forms make rock exposure of the granitic Idaho Batholith easy to identify.

25. Consider the following regarding tropical rain forests:
1. The soils of these forests lack humus content.
2. It has layered vegetation.
3. These forests have thick undergrowth.
Which of the above statements are correct?
a) All of the above
b) 2 only
c) 1 and 2
d) 2 and 3
Answer: C
 This high level of precipitation often results in poor soils due to leaching of soluble nutrients in the ground.
Rainforests are divided into different strata, or layers, with vegetation organized into a vertical pattern from the top of the soil to the canopy. Each layer is a unique biotic community containing different plants and animals adapted for life in those particular strata. Only the emergent layer is unique to tropical rainforests, while the others are also found in temperate rainforests.
The forest floor, the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. Hence it has very less undergrowth.

28. Most of the coastal west flowing rivers are short because:
a) The coastal plains between Eastern Ghats and Arabian Sea are narrow.
b) The coastal plains between Western Ghats and Arabian Sea are narrow.
c) The coastal plains between Western Ghats and Arabian Sea are very broad.
d) The coastal plains between Eastern Ghats and Bay of Bengal are very narrow.
Answer: B
 Western Ghats is a continuous range right from southern Gujarat till South Kerala except at few passes like Palaghat, Bolaghat etc. And the west coast is much much narrower as compared to the Eastern coast. This makes entire orographic rainfall occurring at western side of Western Ghats to drain towards Arabian sea. Since western coast is narrow, we find rivers to be having very short course.

30. Consider the following statements:
1. Annular pattern is characterized by out flowing rivers, away from a central point.
2. The drainage pattern in which the rivers flow almost parallel to each other is known as parallel drainage.
3. In radial pattern the subsequent streams follow curving or arcuate courses prior to joining the consequent stream.
4. The drainage pattern marked by right-angled bends and right-angled junctions between tributaries and the main stream is known as rectangular drainage.
Which of the above statements are incorrect?
a) All of the above
b) 1 and 3
c) 2 and 4
d) None of the above
Answer: B
 Rectangular Drainage: The drainage pattern marked by right-angled bends and right-angled junctions between tributaries and the main stream is known as rectangular drainage. It differs from the trellis pattern in so far as it is more irregular and its tributary streams are neither as long, nor parallel as in trellis drainage. A typical example of this drainage pattern is found is the Vindhyan Mountains of India.
Radial Pattern: It is a pattern characterised by outflowing rivers, away from a central point, analogous with the spokes of a wheel. It tends to develop on the flanks of a dome or a volcanic cone. A good example of a radial drainage pattern is provided by the rivers originating from the Amarkantak mountain.
Rivers like Narmada, Son and Mahanadi originating from Amarkantak Hills flow in different directions and are good examples of radial pattern. Radial drainage patterns are also found/in the Girnar Hills (Kathiwar, Gujarat), and Mikir Hills of Assam.
Annular Pattern: In this drainage pattern, the subsequent streams follow curving or arcuate courses prior to joining the consequent stream. This results from a partial adaptation to an underground circular struc-ture; a dome like igneous intrusion (batholith). The subsequent streams find it easier to erode the concentric, less resistant strata. This is not a very common drainage pattern in India. Some examples of this are however found in Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand), Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Parallel Drainage: The drainage pattern in which the rivers flow almost parallel to each other is known as parallel drainage. The small and swift rivers originating in the Western Ghats and discharging their water into the Arabian Sea provide a good example of parallel drainage pattern in India.

4. Godavari
Select the correct option from below:
a) All of the above
b) 1, 2 and 4
c) 2, 3 and 4
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 Majority of the rivers in the peninsular India originate in The Western Ghats, they either flow westwards or eastwards. The  westward flowing rivers have a much shorter length to traverse to drain themselves into the Arabian sea, so carry a less deposit/sediment with them and hence a delta can't be formed.
On the other hand eastward flowing rivers (eg. Mahanadi, Godavari etc.)  travel a longer path way greater than their counterpart. So till they reach the eastern coast, they have eroded the Eastern Ghats and are saturated with sediments. That is why they form deltas & not estuaries on their mouths.
The Godavari River is the second longest river in India after the river Ganges. In terms of length, catchment area and discharge, the Godavari river is the largest in peninsular India and had been dubbed as the 'Dakshina Ganga' - the South Ganges river. It makes a joint delta with Krishna.
The other three rivers are west flowing. They do not form deltas.

41. Consider the following regarding peninsular rivers:
1. They are flowing at their base level.
2. They have seasonal streams.
3. They are highly erosive in character.
4. None of them make deltas.
Which of the above statements are correct?
a) All of them
b) 1,2 and 3
c) 1 and 2
d) 1,2 and 4
Answer: C
 Peninsular rivers are very old and have been flowing over this topography for a very long time. Most of them have already eroded the terrain to the base level and hence erosion is very less.
They are seasonal rivers i.e. dependent on rainfall. Most of the rivers flowing towards eastern coast are large and form deltas. While west flowing rivers do not travel a large distance, most of them meet Arabian Sea in their youth stage itself where they do not have much sediment load. So, most of them make estuaries rather than a delta.

42. Consider the following statements regarding 'Thermal Pollution'.
1. It will decrease the metabolic activities of aquatic animals
2. Reproduction among aquatic animals will increase.
3. Bacterial activity will be limited in the water system
4. High temperature will increase the dispersion of oxygen into deeper waters thus leading to aerobic condition.
Select the correct statement/s
a) 1, 2, 3, 4
b) 2 and 3
c) 3 and 4
d) None
Answer: D
 The release of heated water into the aquatic bodies changes the average water temperature and concentration of dissolved oxygen. Elevated temperature decreases the level of dissolved oxygen in water which is harmful to aquatic animals like fishes, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. High temperature limits oxygen dispersion into deeper waters, leading to anaerobic conditions. It can lead to increased bacterial population. Several aquatic species fail to reproduce at elevated temperature. The eggs of trout fail to hatch while salmon does not spawn as higher temperature. Thermal pollution may also increase the metabolic rate of aquatic animals, as enzyme activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time. An increased metabolic rate may result in fewer resources causing a sharp decrease in a population.
A large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturation of enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down fats, which leads to malnutrition

1. Youth stage
2. Mature stage
3. Old stage
4. Toddler stage
Select the correct answer from the codes below:
a) 1 only
b) 1 and 2
c) 1,2 and 4
d) All of the above
Answer: B
 The course of a river has been divided into three stages- youth, mature and old.
In youth stage, river has high energy and it flows from steep slopes. It has highly erosive character and forms different landforms like V-shape valley, rapids, cascades, waterfalls, pot holes, plunge pools etc.
As river enters a relatively plain area, it enters into mature stage. The volume of river water increases but its speed slows down. In this stage river shows erosion and deposition simultaneously. On one end, it makes cliff bank on meanders and on the other side it makes point bars.
Loaded with sediments a river enters in its old stage where erosion stops and only deposition takes place. It makes natural levees, flood plains, braided channels, river islands and deltas.

a) 1, 2 and 4
b) 1, 2 and 3
c) 1, 3 and 4
d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Answer: A
 Red soil is a group of soil that develop in a warm, temperate, moist climate under deciduous or mixed forests and that have thin organic and organic-mineral layers overlying a yellowish-brown leached layer resting on an illuvial (see illuviation) red layer. Red soils generally derived from crystaline rock. They are usually poor growing soils, low in nutrients and humus and difficult to cultivate because of its low water holding capacity.
In general these soils are deficient in lime, magnesia, phosphates, nitrogen, humus and potash. Intense leaching is a menace to these soils. On the uplands, they are thin, poor and gravelly, sandy, or stony and porous, light-colored soils on which food crops like bajra can be grown. But on the lower plains and valleys they are rich, deep, dark colored fertile loam on which, under irrigation, they can produce excellent crops like cotton, wheat, pulses, tobacco, jowar, linseed, millet, potatoes and fruits.

2. As the size of particle in soil increases, the water holding capacity of soil increases.
Select the correct statements
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
Answer: A
 Soil texture is described by a series of names that emphasise the dominant particle size, whether sand , silt and clay. A Loam is a mixture containing a substantial proportion of each of the three grades. Loams are classified as sandy, silty, or clay rich when one of these grades are dominat.
Texture largely determines the ability of the soil to retain water. Coarse textured soils have large gaps between soil particles which allow water to easily penetrate them and have less water holding capacity.
Hence larger the particle, lower is its water holding capacity.

72. Consider the following statements:
1. Soil with high base status is generally very fertile.
2. Humus colloids have high capacity to hold bases hence presence of base is usually associated with high soil fertility.
Which of these above statements are correct?
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both
d) Neither
Answer: C
 From the view point of soil fertility, the ability of a clay mineral to hold base ions is its most important property. This ability varies with the particular type of clay mineral, some hold bases tightly and others loosely.
If clay minerals can hold abundant base ions, the soil is of high base status and generally will be highly fertile.
Humus colloids have a high capacity to hold bases so that the presence of humus is usually associated with potentially high soil fertility.

73. Consider the following statements regarding vertical distribution of temperature in oceans.
1. The first layer is called homogenous layer because the temperature is uniform because of mixing of water.
2. The layer in which the temperature rapidly decreases is called Thermocline .
3. Thermocline layer is absent in polar areas.
4. In third layer the temperature decreases slowly and then becomes constant after certain depth.
Choose the correct statement:
a) All of the above
b) 1 and 2
c) 1 ,3 and 4
d) 1,2 and 4
Answer: A
 The temperature-depth profile for the ocean water shows how the temperature decreases with the increasing depth. The profile shows a boundary region between the surface waters of the ocean and the deeper layers. The boundary usually begins around 100 - 400 m below the sea surface and extends several hundred of metres downward. This boundary region, from where there is a rapid decrease of temperature, is called the thermocline . About 90 per cent of the total volume of water is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. In this zone, temperatures approach 0° C. The temperature structure of oceans over middle and low latitudes can be described as a three-layer system from surface to the bottom.
The first layer represents the top layer of warm oceanic water and it is about 500m thick with temperatures ranging between 20° and 25° C. This layer, within the tropical region, is present throughout the year but in mid latitudes it develops only during summer. The second layer called the thermocline layer lies below the first layer and is characterized by rapid decrease in temperature with increasing depth. Since, at poles the surface temperature is very low, a thermocline is not seen in the temperature profile.

75. Which of the following statement is wrong?  
a) Salinity at equator is less than it is at the tropics because of higher precipitation at the equator.
b) In general salinity decreases as we move from lower latitudes to upper latitudes.
c) Salinity is higher at the mouth of the river as more minerals are added by the river water.
d) In general, Inland seas and lakes have higher salinity than open ocean .
Answer: C
 All waters in nature, whether rain water or ocean water, contain dissolved mineral salts. Salinity is the term used to define the total content of dissolved salts in sea water. Salinity is an important property of sea water. Salinity of 
24.7 o/oo has been considered as the upper limit to demarcate 'brackish water'.
Factors affecting ocean salinity are mentioned below: · The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depend mainly on evaporation · and precipitation.
· Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by the fresh water flow from rivers, and in Polar Regions by the processes of freezing and thawing of ice.
· Wind, also influences salinity of an area by transferring water to other areas.
· The ocean currents contribute to the salinity variations. Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated. Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the salinity of water in an area.
At the mouth of a river, the salinity decreases as fresh water is added by the river.

76. Identify the element which is not a part of the hydrological cycle
a) Evaporation
b) Precipitation
c) Hydration
d) Condensation
Answer: C
 The other three processes i.e. Evaporation, condensation and precipitation are physical processes involving, change in the physical state of water by releasing or taking heat energy. All the three processes are involved in hydrological cycle.
On contrary, hydration is a chemical process in which water reacts with other elements. This has got no relation with hydrological cycle directly.

77. Consider the following statements:
a) Waves transport water to thousands of kilometers.
b) Size of a wave is directly propotional to the strength of the wind.
c) The highest point of the wave is called its crest.
d) The actual motion of water beneath the wave is circular. 
Which of the above statement is incorrect?
Answer: A
 Waves are actually the energy, not the water as such, which moves across the ocean surface.
Water particles only travel in a small circle as a wave passes. Wind provides energy to the waves. Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on shorelines.
The actual motion of the water beneath the waves is circular. It indicates that things are carried up and forward as the wave approaches, and down and back as it passes.
The highest and lowest points of a wave are called the crest and trough respectively.

78. Consider the following statements:
1. The periodic rise and fall of the sea level once or twice a day, due to gravitational pull of sun and moon are called tides.

Select the correct statements:
a) All of the above
b) 1 and 3
c) 2 and 3
d) 1 only 
Answer: D
 · The periodical rise and fall of the sea level, once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and the moon, is called a  tide .
· Movements of water caused by meteorological effects (winds and atmospheric pressure changes) are called surges . Surges are not regular like tides.
· The moon's gravitational pull to the greater extent and sun's gravitational pull to lesser extent are responsible to the tides.
· Another important factor is the centrifugal force due to the rotation of earth which acts as a counter balance to the gravitational pull.

79. What are tidal currents?
a) Movement of water caused by meteorological effects (winds and atmospheric pressure change.
b) When the tide is channeled between islands or into bays and estuaries.
c) Ocean currents during spring tides.
d) When water gets onto sea shore during a tsunami.
Answer: B
 The shape of bays and estuaries along a coastline can also magnify the intensity of tides.
Funnel-shaped bays greatly change tidal magnitudes. When the tide is channeled between islands or into bays and estuaries they are called tidal currents .

2. Tidal ranges are much less during perihelion.
Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both
d) Neither 
Answer: B
 Once in a month, when the moon's orbit is closest to the earth (perigee) , unusually high and low tides occur. During this time the tidal range is greater than normal. Two weeks later, when the moon is farthest from earth (apogee) , the moon's gravitational force is limited and the tidal ranges are less than their average heights.
When the earth is closest to the sun (perihelion) , around 3rd January each year, tidal ranges are also much greater, with unusually high and unusually low tides. When the earth is farthest from the sun (aphelion) , around 4th July each year, tidal ranges are much less than average.

Answer: D
 Ocean currents are like river flow in oceans. They represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction. Ocean currents are influenced by two types of forces namely: · primary forces that initiate the movement of Water · secondary forces that influence the currents to flow.
The primary forces that influence the currents are: · heating by solar energy; · wind; · gravity; · coriolis force Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope. Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course. Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation. The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.

84. Consider the following statements:
1. Coriolis force exists due to the rotation of the earth.
2. Coriolis force causes the wind in Northern hemisphere to move towards its right while it causes ocean current in northern hemisphere to move towards its left.
Which of the above statements are correct?
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neithr 1 nor 2
Answer: A
 Coriolis force exists due to rotation of earth on its axis. The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.

86. Consider the following statements:
1. Ocean currents are a means to maintain heat balance on earth by taking access heat from lower latitudes to higher latitudes.
2. Cold currents move from higher latitudes to lower latitudes while warm currents flow from lower latitudes to upper latitudes.
Which of the above statements are correct?
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
Answer: C
 Since tropical zone receives perpendicular sun's rays throughout the year, the net heat received in this region is higher than the polar areas. Hence there is a heat surplus in this region. All the weather phenomenon occurs broadly because of this heat difference so that heat can be distributed across the globe. Ocean currents are one such phenomenon to transfer access heat received by the oceans.
This is done when warm currents take access heat from the lower latitudes to upper latitudes and cold currents from higher latitudes comes to lower latitudes.

88. Spring tides are caused
a) As result of the moon and the sun pulling the earth gravitationally in the same direction.
b) As result of the moon and the sun pulling the earth gravitationally in the opposite direction.
c) Indention in the coast line.
d) None of the above.
Answer: A
 The position of both the sun and the moon in relation to the earth has direct bearing on tide height. When the sun, the moon and the earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher. These are called spring tides and they occur twice a month, one on full moon period and another during new moon period.

92. Consider the following regarding upwelling of water.
1. It is generally seen on the eastern coast of the continents.
2. It brings cold water and nutrients to the surface of the ocean.
3. Upwelling zone is good for fishing.
4. It creates low pressure condition above the ocean surface.
Which of the above statements are correct.
a) All of the above
b) 1, 2 and 3
c) 2 and 3
d) 1 and 4
Answer: C
 Upwelling results in emergence of cold water from the deeper ocean to the surface. This water brings with it loads of nutrients which support massive plankton growth which is good for fish breeding. Hence these areas are highly productive for fishing.
Upwelling is generally seen on the western coasts of the continents eg. Peru coast.
Since cold water comes to the surface, the air in contact gets cold and heavy. Hence a high pressure condition prevails over the surface.

93. Consider the following statements:
a) Soil structure refers to the way in which soil grains are grouped together in to large masses.
b) Granular and blocky structure soils are easy to cultivate.
c) Dry clayey soils are sticky and are difficult to be worked.
d) Soils with high clay content can lack peds . Which of the above statement is false?
Answer: C
 Soil structure describes the arrangement of the solid parts of the soil and of the pore space located between them. It is determined by how individual soil granules clump or bind together and aggregate, and therefore, the arrangement of soil pores between them. Soil structure has a major influence on water and air movement, biological activity, root growth and seedling emergence.
Granular and blocky structures are easy to cultivate as they are easy to work. Soils with large clay content usually lack peds. They become heavy and sticky when wet so they are difficult to work. Also when dry they become very hard and develop cracks.

1. It contains crucial information on macro nutrients in the soil, secondary nutrients, micro nutrients, and physical parameters
2. It would increase the problem of temporary inundation.
3. It has been rolled out to check the excess use of fertilizers.
Select the correct code:
a) 1 and 2 Only
b) 1 and 3 Only
c) 2 and 3 Only
d) 3 Only 
Answer: B
 The Soil Health Card is a printed report that will be given to farmers once in three years for each of his/her land holding. It will contain crucial information on macro nutrients in the soil, secondary nutrients, micro nutrients, and physical parameters. The card will be accompanied by an advisory on the corrective measures that a farmer should take to improved soil health and obtain a better yield.
Excess use of fertilizer results into salt encrustation impeding infiltration so locally, inundation is witnessed. Since, it is to check the excess use of fertilizers so it will reduce the problem of temporary inundation.

100. Recently Vodafone won transfer pricing tax dispute. Consider the following w.r.t Transfer Pricing
1. If a subsidiary company sells goods to a parent company, the cost of those goods paid by the parent to the subsidiary is the transfer price.
2. It is the setting of the price for goods and services sold between controlled legal entities within an enterprise.
3. Transactions may include the trade of supplies or labor between departments.
Select the correct statement[s]
a) 1 and 2
b) 2 and 3
c) Only 1
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 The price at which divisions of a company transact with each other. Transactions may include the trade of supplies or labor between departments. Transfer prices are used when individual entities of a larger multi-entity firm are treated and measured as separately run entities.
Transfer pricing  is the setting of the price for goods and services sold between controlled (or related) legal entities within an enterprise. For example, if a subsidiary company sells goods to a parent company, the cost of those goods paid by the parent to the subsidiary is the transfer price. Legal entities considered under the control of a single corporation include branches and companies that are wholly or majority owned ultimately by the parent corporation. Certain jurisdictions consider entities to be under common control if they share family members on their boards of directors. Transfer pricing can be used as a profit allocation method to attribute a multinational corporation's net profit (or loss) before tax to countries where it does business. Transfer pricing results in the setting of prices among divisions within an enterprise.
