Select the correct option from the following:
a) 1 and 2
b) 3 and 4
c) 1,2 and 4
d) All of the above 
Answer: D
· NCERT Indian Economic Development Ch-5 
· Investment in education is considered as one of the main sources of human capital. There are several other sources as well. Investments in health, on the job training, migration and information are the other sources of human capital formation.
· Spending on education by individuals is similar to spending on capital goods by companies with the objective of increasing future profits over a period of time. Likewise, individuals invest in education with the objective of increasing their future income. Preventive medicine (vaccination), curative medicine (medical intervention during illness), social medicine (spread of health literacy) and provision of clean drinking water and good sanitation are the various forms of health expenditures. Health expenditure directly increases the supply of healthy labour force and is, thus, a source of human capital formation.
Unemployment is the reason for the rural-urban migration in India. Technically qualified persons, like engineers and doctors, migrate to other countries because of higher salaries that they may get in such countries. Migration in both these cases involves cost of transport, higher cost of living in the migrated places and psychic costs of living in a strange socio-cultural setup. The enhanced earnings in the new place outweigh the costs of migration; hence, expenditure on migration is also a source of human capital formation. People spend to acquire information relating to the labour market and other markets like education and health. This information is necessary to make decisions regarding investments in human capital as well as for efficient utilisation of the acquired human capital stock.
· Expenditure incurred for acquiring information relating to the labour market and other markets is also a source of human capital formation

24. Consider the following statements:
1. MSP is the minimum price at which the government promises to buy the crop from the farmers.
2. MSP protects the farmer in case of a bumper crop.
3. The price support scheme for oil seeds and pulses is implemented through National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd.(NAFED)
Select the correct statement:
a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) 1 and 2
d) All of the above
Answer: D
· Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a form of market intervention by the Government of India to insure agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices. The minimum support prices are announced by the Government of India at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). MSP is price fixed by Government of India to protect the producer - farmers - against excessive fall in price during bumper production years. The minimum support prices are a guarantee price for their produce from the Government. The major objectives are to support the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for public distribution. In case the market price for the commodity falls below the announced minimum price due to bumper production and glut in the market, government agencies purchase the entire quantity offered by the farmers at the announced minimum price.
· If there is a fall in the prices of the crops, after a bumper harvest, the government purchases at the MSP and this is the reason that the priced cannot go below MSP. So this directly helps the farmers. The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation implements the Price Support Scheme for Oil Seeds and Pulses through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED).
NAFED is the nodal procurement agency for Oilseeds and pulses, apart from the Cotton Corporation of India. So, when the prices of oilseeds, pulses and cotton fall below MSP, NAFED purchases them from the farmers.

Answer: C
· Communal Award In August 1932, Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, announced a scheme of representation of the minorities, which came to be known as the Communal Award. The award not only continued separate electorates for the Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians and Europeans but also extended it to the depressed classes (scheduled castes). Gandhiji was distressed over this extension of the principle of communal representation to the depressed classes and undertook fast unto death in Yeravada Jail (Poona) to get the award modified. At last, there was an agreement between between Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi on 24 September 1932 at Yerwada Central Jail in Pune (now in Maharashtra), India. It was signed by Pt Madan Mohan Malviya and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and some Dalit leaders to break the fast unto death undertaken by Gandhi in Yerwada jail to annul Macdonald Award giving separate electorate to Dalits for electing members of state legislative assemblies in British India.
· The agreement, known as Poona Pact, retained the Hindu joint electorate and gave reserved seats to the depressed classes

74. Yellow revolution in India refers to the growth of
a) Smuggling of drugs
b) Increase in solar power
c) Oil seed production
d) Jaundice outbreak
Answer: C
· The oilseeds production scenario in India has witnessed a dramatic turn. The country achieved a status of 'self sufficient and net exporter' during early nineties, rising from the 'net importer' state, with a mere annual production of nearly 11 million tonnes from the annual oilseed crops, until the year 1986- 87. In a span of just a decade, an all time record oilseeds production of 25 million tonnes from annual oilseed crops was attained during 1996 ,97 . This transformation has been termed as "The Yellow Revolution" and could be primarily attributed to the institutional support, particularly the set up of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds in 19
86. Significant outcome of the Mission and other related developments included the following; the improved oilseeds production technology, the expansion in cultivated area, and the price support policy. As a result, the gains made possible were none short of a revolution and were rightly named as the yellow revolution.

77. Select the incorrect option
a) Ozone in stratosphere acts as a protective layer while ozone in lower atmosphere acts as a pollutant
b) Ozone hole has been found only at lower latitudes.
c) Montreal protocol has been adopted to ban ozone depleting substances.
d) UV radiations can be harmful to living tissues.
Answer: B
· Ozone depletion refers to the phenomenon of reductions in the amount of ozone in the stratosphere.
The problem of ozone depletion is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere. The origins of these compounds are chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), used as cooling substances in air conditioners and refrigerators, or as aerosol propellants, and bromofluoro carbons ( halons ), used in fire extinguishers. As a result of depletion of the ozone layer, more ultraviolet (UV) radiation comes to Earth and causes damage to living organisms. UV radiation seems responsible for skin cancer in humans; it also lowers production of phytoplankton and thus affects other aquatic organisms. It can also influence the growth of terrestrial plants. A reduction of approximately 5 per cent in the ozone layer was detected from1979 to 19
90. Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet light from passing through the Earth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern. This led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol banning the use of chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) compounds, as well as other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethane (also known as methyl chloroform), and bromine ,compounds known as halons .
· Ozone in lower atmosphere can cause chocking and photochemical smog. In large quantities it can prove to be fatal.
· Because of the formation of polar vortex at poles and long winters, the ozone holes are only found at poles and not on lower latitudes.
