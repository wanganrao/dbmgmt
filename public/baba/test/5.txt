Which of the following code are not responsible for growth of Buddhism and Jainism?
a) 1 and 2
b) 2 and 3 only
c) 1, 2, and 3
d) None of the above
Answer: D
 The complex rituals and sacrifices advocated in the Later Vedic period were not acceptable to the common people. The sacrificial ceremonies were also found to be too expensive. The superstitious beliefs and mantras confused the people. The teachings of Upanishads, an alternative to the system of sacrifices, were highly philosophical in nature and therefore not easily understood by all. Therefore, what was needed in the larger interests of the people was a simple, short and intelligible way to salvation for all people Social and economic factors also contributed to the rise of these two religions. The rigid caste system prevalent in India generated tensions in the society.
The growth of trade and urbanisation led to the improvement in the economic conditions of the Vaisyas .
As a result, they wanted to enhance their social status but the orthodox Varna system did not allow this.
Therefore, they began to extend support to Buddhism and Jainism.

Answer: A
 The doctrine of subsidiary alliance was introduced by Lord Wellesley, British Governor-General in India from 1798 to 18
05. Early in his governorship Wellesley adopted a policy of non-intervention in the  princely states, but he later adopted the policy of forming subsidiary alliances. This policy was to play a major role in British expansion in India.
According to the term of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed force. They were to be protected by the company, but had to pay for the 'subsidiary forces' that the company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection.
If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first to enter into such an alliance. Tipu Sultan of Mysore refused to do so, but after the British victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, Mysore was forced to become a subsidiary state. The Nawab of Awadh was the next to accept the Subsidiary Alliance, in 18 01. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the Maratha ruler Baji Rao II also accepted a subsidiary alliance.

 What is Cloud Computing?
· Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
· Cloud computing in simple terms can be defined as storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. It doesn't just end there. Cloud in the term of Cloud Computing refers to set of hardware, networks, storage, services, and interfaces that combine to deliver aspects of computing as a service.
· So, it is not just that you are going to share information but in cloud computing even the infrastructure can be shared on real time basis on the internet.
MeghRaj · Meghraj is the name given to the initiative of Government of India for its new program which is going to take advantage of the Cloud Computing. Meghraj is just a name coined for the purpose ( Megh =Cloud, Raj=Rule i.e. Rule of Cloud Computing). As much absurd the name seems, but the advantages the Indians will get from this technology are immense. Another name for Meghraj is the GI Cloud Initiative.
· It will enable the government to leverage cloud computing for effective delivery of e-services.
What are the components of Governments Cloud Computing? . Five essential characteristics (viz. on-demand self service, ubiquitous network access, metered use, elasticity and resource pooling) . three service models (infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service) . four deployment models (public cloud, private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud) · The Cloud Computing initiative envision to accelerate delivery of e-services provided by the government and to optimize ICT spending of the government.

b) 2 and 3
c) 1 and 3
d) 1, 2 and 3
Answer: D
 VOIP is IP enabled voice calling technology over internet. Example: Skype, Yahoo messenger, MSN messenger.
Disadvantages of VOIP are: · It dependent on broadband network connectivity, no internet no calling.
· The quality of voice depends on broadband bandwidth and speed.
· Power shortage can hamper VOIP calling as it's totally dependent on power enabled devices.
· No emergency calling features like normal and Smartphone.
· Highest disadvantage of VOIP is security. It's really tough to trace the source and identity if an imposter is on work.
· Threats like phishing, spoofing and sniffing, call tampering etc is very common.
In India, it is legal to use VoIP, but it is illegal to have VoIP gateways inside India. This effectively means that people who have PCs can use them to make a VoIP call to any number, but if the remote side is a normal phone, the gateway that converts the VoIP call to a  POTS call should not be inside India.

2. Li- Fi can be used under the water surfaces
3. Li- Fi can be safely used on planes because it does not interfere with radio equipment
Select the correct statement/s
a) 1 and 2
b) 1, 2 and 3

 Li- Fi is the latest communication technology which can transmit data using the spectrum of visible light.
The data receiver would have to be in sight of the transmitter-bulb as visible light does not penetrate solid materials. It is an advantage as the hackers won't be able to hack Li- Fi network without being in sight.
Advantages · Visible light is more plentiful than the radio waves. (more bandwidth) · Visible light can achieve far greater data density.
· Can be used underwater without radio interference because salt conducts electricity · Transmission can be blocked by walls so there is less risk for data leaking · Can be safely used on planes because it does not interfere with radio equipment.

37. The word spectrum refers to a collection of various types of electromagnetic radiations of different wavelengths. Consider the following w.r.t 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz bands
1. 1800 Mhz band is superior to 900 Mhz due to its universal use
2. It is because of laws of Physics that for any wave, higher the frequency of the wave, higher will be the distance travelled by it
Select the correct statement/s
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both
d) None
Answer: D
 According to laws of Physics, for any wave, higher the frequency of the wave, lesser will be the distance travelled by it. So naturally, frequencies of 900 Mhz will cover more distance than the frequencies of
1800 Mhz & hence mobile operators are more interested in the 900 Mhz frequency.
More investment needed by the companies who buy 1800 Mhz frequency spectrum: 1800 Mhz frequency has poor coverage than the 900 Mhz frequency. So, for matching the existing coverage mobile operators have to install additional base stations (i.e. mobile towers) to give the same effect as the frequencies under 900 Mhz.
Also, hardware equipments required for carrying out operation of 1800 Mhz frequency are costly. Main reason behind it, is that 900 Mhz frequency band has been in use for mobile communications globally for over 20 years and as a result technology standards have been better developed compared with 1800 Mhz band, which has been in use only recently.
