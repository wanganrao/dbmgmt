1. Consider the following statements
1. It is world's most problematic aquatic weed
2. It is also called Terror of Bengal
Above statements fits for? 
1. Eichhornia
2. Azolla
3. Wolffia
4. Trapa
Answer:  1
You may have seen the beautiful mauve-colored flowers found on very appealingly-shaped floating plants in water bodies. These plants which were introduced into India for their lovely flowers have caused havoc by their excessive growth by causing blocks in our waterways. They grow faster than our ability to remove them. These are plants of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), the world's most problematic aquatic weed, also called 'Terror of Bengal'. They grow abundantly in eutrophic water bodies, and lead to an imbalance in the ecosystem dynamics of the water body.

2. Consider the following statements
1. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is the measure of organic matter present in the water.
2. Greater the BOD, lesser is the polluting potential.
3. Microbes in sewage treatment plants increases the BOD of the effluent
Which of the above are NOT correct? 
1. 1 and 2
2. 2 and 3
3. Only 3
4. Only 2
Answer:  2
Greater the BOD more is the polluting potential. Actually, in secondary treatment or biological treatment of sewage water in plant, the primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks where it is constantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs (masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part of the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent. BOD refers to the amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.  The sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.

5. Methanogens are common in Wetlands and are responsible for marsh gas. Consider the following w.r.t it
1. They are also found in ruminants of animals but not in human
2. They play significant role in aerobic wastewater treatment
3. They produce oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and methane
Choose the correct options
1. 1, 2 and 3
2. 1 and 2
3. 2 and 3
4. None
Answer:  4
They are common in wetlands, where they are responsible for marsh gas, and in the digestive tracts of animals such as ruminants and humans, where they are responsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in humans.  Moreover, the methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments.  They are anaerobic organisms and cannot function under aerobic conditions NCERT- BIO-12 th , Chapter 10

Answer:  2
Lady bird and Butterflies are used to get rid of Aphids. Fungi are also known to form symbiotic associations with plants (mycorrhiza). Many members of the genus Glomus form mycorrhiza. A biological control being developed for use in the treatment of plant disease is the fungus Trichoderma. Trichoderma species are free-living fungi that are very common in the root ecosystems. They are effective biocontrol agents of several plant pathogens.  Methanobacterium is related to Biogas

7. If your COW is producing average MILK as compared to the cow of other breed, the best method to increase its efficiency would be? 
1. In-breeding
2. Out-breeding
3. Out-crossing
4. None
Answer:  3
This is the practice of mating of animals within the same breed, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to 4-6 generations. The offspring of such a mating is known as an out-cross. It is the best breeding method for animals that are below average in productivity in milk production, growth rate in beef cattle, etc.
