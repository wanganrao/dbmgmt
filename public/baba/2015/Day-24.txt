Temperature inversion will affect? 
1. Only 1
2. 1 and 2
3. 2 and 3
4. 1, 2 and 3
Answer:  4
Besides trapping smog, inversions also trap sound waves. Because of this, the loud sounds of things like airplanes taking off will seem louder as the sound waves refract off the inversion layer and back down to the ground.  But sound waves aren't the only thing that gets refracted by weather inversions. Light can be bent by the inconsistency of the temperature. When an inversion is not present, but the ground temperature is significantly hotter than the air higher up like in the desert, the bending of light causes mirages in the form of thinking that there is a lake or puddle up ahead. Really, it is the sky reflecting off of the ground because of the extreme change in temperature When there is a temperature inversion, the affect is just the opposite. If the inversion is strong enough, it can cause far off objects to look like they are floating above the ground. If things are far enough they are past the curvature of the earth, they may become visible.  This reverse or "superior" mirage is called looming.  Very high frequency radio waves can be refracted by inversions, making it possible to hear FM radio or watch VHF low-band television broadcasts from long distances on foggy nights. The signal, which would normally be refracted up and away from the groundbased antenna, is instead refracted down towards the earth by the temperature-inversion boundary layer. This phenomenon is called tropospheric ducting.

4. Tropospheric Ozone consists of
1. Sulphur Dioxide
2. Methane
3. Nitrogen Oxides
4. Volatile Organic Compounds
5. Carbon Monoxide
Choose the correct options
1. 1, 2, 4 and 5
2. 2, 3, 4 and 5
3. 1, 2, 3 and 4
4. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
Answer:  2
CO, VOCs and NO are called Ozone precursors. VOCs include methane also.

5. Consider the following statements regarding ozone depletion
1. Polar Stratospheric Clouds inhibits ozone depletion
2. Ozone depletion will affect human body by enhancing the chances of skin cancer and reduced level of Vitamin D in the body.
3. Montreal Protocol and Vienna Convention are related to Ozone Depleting Substances
Select the wrong statements
1. Only 2
2. 1 and 3
3. 1 and 2
4. Only 1
Answer:  3
PSC enhances the depletion of ozone because they support chemical reactions that produce reactive chorine molecules which catalyzes ozone destruction. Ozone depletion means more UV rays coming on earth and it will actually enhance the formation of Vitamin D. Third statement is correct.

6. Consider the following
1. Photochemical Smog
2. Acid Rains
3. Death of vegetation
4. Loss of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystem
5. Damage to buildings
Sulphur dioxide contributes to all of the problems mentioned above except
1. Only 1
2. 1 and 3
3. Only 3
4. 3 and 4
Answer:  1
Sulphur is not present in the formation of Photochemical smog

7. How do CFCs reduce the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere? 
1. Radiation caused CFCs to release atoms that converts ozone to oxygen
2. CFCs splits into troposphere and combine with carbon dioxide to form oxygen
3. CFCs splits into the troposphere and oxidise, preventing the formation of ozone
4. CFCs combine with ozone to produce oxidised molecules
Answer:  1
CFCs releases chlorine atoms (radicals) that are responsible the chain reaction leading to formation of oxygen thereby inhibiting the concentration of ozone

8. Mercury is particularly hazardous to human health because
1. It bioaccumulates high up the food chain.
2. As a heavy metal, it can cause serious impact injury.
3. It is light and volatile, and so is widely dispersed through the environment by wind.
4. As a pure metal it is very soluble in water, hence easily absorbed through drinking water.
Answer:  1

9. A high Biological Oxygen Demand indicates
1. Low level of microbial pollution
2. High level of microbial pollution
