a) It is a Constitutional right
b) The Supreme Court can issue writ jurisdiction, for the violation of the right.
c) The right to property was deleted from Fundamental Rights by the 42th Amendment Act, 1976. 
Select the correct answer
1) c Only
2) a Only
3) a and b
4) a and c
Answer: 2
44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished the right to property as a Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 from Part III. Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in Part XII. It provides that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law. Thus, the right to property still remains a legal right or a constitutional right, though no longer a fundamental right. It is not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Writs are issued by Supreme Court only for the violation of the Fundamental Rights not legal rights.

6. Article 19, in the Indian Constitution guarantees to all citizens six rights (Right to Freedom). Consider the following with reference to Freedom of Movement
a) The entry of outsiders in tribal areas is restricted
b) The freedom of movement of prostitutes can be restricted on the ground of public health
Select the correct answer using the code given below:
1) a Only
2) b Only
3) Both a and b
4) None
Answer: 3
The grounds of imposing reasonable restrictions on this freedom are two, namely, the interests of general public and the protection of interests of any scheduled tribe. The entry of outsiders in tribal areas is restricted to protect the distinctive culture, language, customs and manners of scheduled tribes and to safeguard their traditional vocation and properties against exploitation.  The Supreme Court held that the freedom of movement of prostitutes can be restricted on the ground of public health and in the interest of public morals. The Bombay High Court validated the restrictions on the movement of persons affected by AIDS.

8. Consider the following:
Assertion (A): The Directive Principles are non-justiciable in nature
Reason (R) :  Any law that gives effect to Directive Principles of State Policy in Article 39(b) and Article 39(c) and in the process the law violates Article 14 or Article 19, then the law is not considered unconstitutional
Select the correct answer using the code given below:
1) Both A and R are True and R is the correct explanation of A
2) Both A and R are True and R is not the correct explanation of A
3) A is True and R is False
4) A is False and R is True
Answer: 2
Assertion and Reasoning both are correct when the statements are considered individually. But R is not the correct reasoning for the assertion stated.  The Directive Principles are non-justiciable in nature, that is, they are not legally enforceable by the courts for their violation. Therefore, the government (Central, state and local) cannot be compelled to implement them.  Reason (R) is a correct statement. The Supreme Court in Minerva Mills Case (1980) declared that DPSP was subordinate to FR's but FR's conferred by Article 14 and Article 19 were accepted as subordinate to the Directive Principles specified in Article 39 (b) and (c).
