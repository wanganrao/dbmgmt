Answer: 4
In ecology, productivity or production refers to the rate of generation of biomass in an ecosystem. It is usually expressed in units of mass per unit surface (or volume) per unit time, for instance grams per square metre per day (g m -2 d -1). The mass unit may relate to dry matter or to the mass of carbon generated. Productivity of autotrophs such as plants is called primary productivity, while that of heterotrophs such as animals is called secondary productivity.

3. Consider the following statements about ecological pyramids
1. Grassland and forest ecosystem have similar Pyramid of Numbers.
2. Pyramid of Biomass is the most accurate among three ecological pyramids-Number, Biomass and Energy.
3. Pyramid of Energy is always upright in nature irrespective of type of ecosystem. 
Select the correct code
1. 1 and 2
2. 1, 2 and 3
3. Only 2
4. Only 3
Answer: 4
There are three ways an ecological pyramid can be represented.  A Pyramid of Numbers can be generated by counting all the organisms at the different feeding levels.  As you might guess, this can be a very difficult task since we are not just identifying each species in the ecosystem. We are also counting how many of each species is present. On occasion, this approach will not work.  For example, one tree (a producer) can represent an ecosystem and harbor numerous populations of herbivores and carnivores. Thus, the bottom of the pyramid would be very small and not flared out.  A second type of pyramid is called a Pyramid of Biomass where organisms are collected from each feeding level, dried and then weighed.  This dry weight (biomass) represents the amount of organic matter (available energy) of the organisms.  [Note that there are alternate, nonlethal ways to determine biomass.] While this approach will generally create a pyramid that illustrates energy flow, its use can also produce an inverted pyramid.  For example, in aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton could reproduce and then be eaten rapidly by zooplankton.  Therefore, it would be possible to have few herbivores and a lot of carnivores when a collection is taken A third type of pyramid called a Pyramid of Energy Flow tends to resolve these problems.  This approach necessitates measuring the caloric value of the different organisms that make up the community.  It nicely shows how energy is continually decreasing along the food chain from producers to top level carnivores.  The pyramids of numbers and biomass may be upright or inverted depending upon the nature of the food chain in the particular ecosystem, whereas pyramids of energy are always upright.  In a forest ecosystem, however, the pyramid of numbers is somewhat different in shape.  The producers, which are mainly large-sized trees, are lesser in number, and form the base of the pyramid. The herbivores, which are the fruit-eating birds, elephants, deer's etc. are more in number than the producers.

4. Which among the following can effectively be examples of 'Secondary Succession'? 
1. Formation of a new Island after volcanic eruption
2. The renewal of a forest after a fire
3. A flooded land
4. The renewal of a crop after harvesting
Select the correct option
1. 1, 2 and 3
2. 2, 3 and 4
3. 1, 3 and 4
4. All
Answer: 2
Examples of secondary succession include:
# The renewal of a forest after a fire: The fire itself destroys a majority of different types of trees and plant life. Because seeds and roots and other plant and tree parts remain in and on the soil, gradually the plants and trees begin to grow again and eventually return to the state of the original ecosystem.
# The renewal of a crop after harvesting: A crop is completed harvested when it
becomes ripe. Without new seeds being planted, the crop can regenerate the following year due to the plants and seeds that remained after harvesting.  # A forest renews after logging: A large amount of trees were chopped down by loggers in order to create building materials. Over time, trees grow in and the area returns to its previous state.
# Renewal after disease: A plant population can be very negatively affected by a variety of infectious plant diseases. If the entire population dies, but the soil and roots remain, it is possible for secondary succession to occur and for the population of those plants to to return.
# A flood can ruin farmlands. However, because the soil remains after the waters recede, over the course of many years a natural secondary succession can occur and the vegetation that had previously grown there can grow again.
# Plants can be very susceptible to attack from pests, particularly if there is an overpopulation of those pests. When this occurs, the plant population in one area can be completely destroyed. However, when the pest overpopulation is resolved, the plants are able to live again and thrive in the soil in which they previously had lived.

5. If the concentration of oxygen gets doubled in the atmosphere, what can be the possible effects of the same?
1. We will die young
2. Most insects will grow bigger in size
3. We will be less prone to sickness
4. Our Vehicle will give better mileage
Select the correct option
1. 1, 2 and 3
2. 1, 3 and 4
3. 1, 2, 3 and 4
4. 2, 3 and 4
Answer: 3
# More oxygen will generate more free radical that will exacerbate the aging process through Oxidative Stress. Oxidative Stress will interfere in numerous cellular processes like protein production, DNA replication etc. Hence age will get reduced.
# Immune system will get a boost as a result of oxidation and hence will help in fighting diseases (Less sickness)
# Many insects rely on gaseous diffusion for respiration therefore the maximum body size depends on the proportion of oxygen gas in the atmosphere. Hence size of insects will increase.
# Oxygen-enriched air improves engine performance by producing hotter reactions and reducing the proportion of nitrogen, which reduces heat transfer and hence will give better mileage.

6. The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It measures-
1. How much of the biological capacity of the planet is demanded by a given human activity or population
2. Ecological Footprints is calculated for overall activity of a nation or population and activities such as industrialization etc.
3. The disadvantage of Ecological Footprint is that it cannot be calculated for individual people or area. 
Select the wrong statement/s
1. 1 and 2
2. Only 2
3. 1 and 3
4. Only 3
Answer: 4
Explanation:
The Ecological Footprint is a resource accounting tool that measures how much biologically productive land and sea is used by a given population or activity, and compares this to how much land and sea is available. Productive land and sea areas support human demands for food, fibre, timber, energy, and space for infrastructure. These areas also absorb the waste products from the human economy. The Ecological Footprint measures the sum of these areas, wherever they physically occur on the planet. The Ecological Footprint is used widely as a management and communication tool by governments, businesses, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations.  Ecological Footprint accounts answer a specific research question: how much of the biological capacity of the planet is demanded by a given human activity or population? To answer this question, the Ecological Footprint measures the amount of biologically productive land and water area an individual, a city, a country, a region, or all of humanity uses to produce the resources it consumes and to absorb the waste it generates with today's technology and resource management practices. This demand on the biosphere can be compared to biocapacity, a measure of the amount of biologically productive land and water available for human use. Biologically productive land includes areas such as cropland, forest, and fishing grounds, and excludes deserts, glaciers, and the open ocean Ecological Footprints can be calculated for individual people, groups of people (such as a nation), and activities (such as manufacturing a product).  The Ecological Footprint of a person is calculated by considering all of the biological materials consumed, and all of the biological wastes generated, by that person in a given year. These materials and wastes each demand ecologically productive areas, such as cropland to grow potatoes, or forest to sequester fossil carbon dioxide emissions. All of these materials and wastes are then individually translated into an equivalent number of global hectares. 

7. Which of the following describes the relationship of Mutualism?
1. Pollination
2. Rhizobium
3. Human and Bacteria
4. Zoochory
Select the correct code-
1. 1, 2 and 3
2. 2. 3 and 4
3. 2 and 4
4. All
Answer: 4
Explanation:
A mutualistic relationship is when two organisms of different species "work together," each benefiting from the relationship. In mycorrhizal associations between plant roots and fungi with the plant providing carbohydrates to the fungus in return for primarily phosphate but also nitrogenous compounds.  Other examples include rhizobia bacteria that fix nitrogen for leguminous plants in return for energy-containing carbohydrates Pollination in which nectar or pollen (food resources) are traded for pollen dispersal (a service) or ant protection of aphids, where the aphids trade sugar-rich honeydew (a byproduct of their mode of feeding on plant sap) in return for defense against predators such as ladybugs.  Zoochory is an example where animals disperse the seeds of plants. This is similar to pollination in that the plant produces food resources (for example, fleshy fruit, overabundance of seeds) for animals that disperse the seeds (service).  The bacteria and the human. A certain kind of bacteria lives in the intestines of humans and many other animals. The human cannot digest all of the food that it eats. The bacteria eat the food that the human cannot digest and partially digest it, allowing the human to finish the job. The bacteria benefit by getting food, and the human benefits by being able to digest the food it eats.

11. Tropical cyclones occur in -
1. tropics only
2. tropics and sub tropics only
3. subtropics only
4. tropic, subtropics and extra-tropics
Answer:  4
In addition to tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types. These kinds of cyclones, known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones, can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation. An extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences, which are typical in higher latitudes. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; although not as frequently, an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone. From space, extratropical storms have a characteristic "comma-shaped" cloud pattern. Extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centres cause powerful winds and high seas
