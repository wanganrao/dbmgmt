2. The difference between the market prices and factor cost is equal to
1. Indirect taxes paid
2. Subsidies received
3. Capital consumption
4. Indirect tax paid minus subsidies received
Answer:  4
Basically, 'factor cost' is the 'input cost' the producer has to incur in the process of producing something (such as cost of capital i.e. interest on loans, raw materials, labour, rent, power, etc.). This is also termed as 'factory price' or 'production cost/price'. This is nothing but 'price' of the commodity from the producer's side. While the 'market prices' is derived after adding the indirect taxes to the factor cost of the product, it means the cost at which the goods reach the market i.e. showrooms (these are the Cenvat/central excise and the CST which are paid by the producers to the Central government in India).

4. Which one of the following statement is true?
1. GDP is always greater then GNP
2. GDP is always lower than GNP
3. GDP is equal to GNP when "income from Abroad" is zero
4. GDP is equal to GNP when "depreciation" is zero
Answer: 3
Gross National Product (GNP) is the GDP of a country added with its 'income from abroad'. The items which are counted in the segment 'Income from Abroad' are:
1. Trade Balance: the net outcome at the year end of the total exports and imports of a country may be positive or negative accordingly added with the GDP.
2. Interest of External LoAnswer: the net outcome on the front of the interest payments i.e.  balance of the inflow (on the money lend out by the economy) and the outflow (on the money borrowed by the economy) of the external interests.
3. Private Remittances: the net outcome of the money which inflows and outflows on account of the 'private transfers'.  The balance of all the three components of the 'Income from Abroad' segment may turn out to be positive or negative. Thus relationship between GDP and GNP depends on the net value of income from abroad. When the income from abroad is zero GDP is equal to GNP.
