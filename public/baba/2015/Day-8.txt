2. "Cornwallis Code was a body of legislation enacted in 1793 by the East India Company to improve the governance". Consider the following statements wrt Cornwallis Code-
1.  To give impetus to Permanent Settlement, Zamindars were given the role of Local Administration.
2.  The Policing and Judicial powers of Zamindar were further enhanced to strengthen the Permanent Settlement System. 
Select the correct code
1. Only 1
2. Only 2
3. Both
4. None
Answer: 4
Explanation:
Cornwallis Code:
The code contained significant provisions-Governing, Policing and judicial and civil administration. Its best known provision was the Permanent Settlement (or the zamindari system enacted in 1793), which established a revenue collection scheme which lasted into the 20th century.  The system, as codified in these regulations, provided that the East India Company's service personnel be divided into three branches: revenue, judicial, and commercial. Private trade was forbidden to the members of the first two branches, and they were instead compensated by a new and generous scale of pay. The land revenue assessment (the major source of revenue) was fixed permanently with zamindars, or hereditary revenue collectors.  These native Indians, provided they paid their land taxes punctually, were treated as landowners, but they were deprived of magisterial and police functions, which were discharged by a newly organized government police. This "permanent settlement" provided the British with an Indian landed class interested in supporting British authority. The local administration was placed in the hands of the revenue collectors of districts. The judiciary was reorganized; there were district judges with magisterial powers responsible to provincial courts in civil cases and to courts of circuit in criminal cases. The law administered was Hindu and Muslim personal law and a modified Muslim criminal code. The higher ranks of the services were restricted to Europeans, thus depriving Indians of any responsible office. 

3. The translation of 'Gentoo Code' was funded and encouraged by Warren Hastings as a method of increasing colonial hold over the Indies. Consider the statements regarding the Gentoo Code-
1. It is also known as Ordinations of the Pundits.
2. It was first translated from Persian to English and then from Persian to Sanskrit
Select the correct option
1. Only 1
2. Only 2
3. Both
4. None
Answer: 1
Explanation: The Gentoo Code is a legal code translated from Sanskrit (in which it was known as vivadar?avasetu) into Persian by Brahmin scholars; and then from Persian into English by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, a British grammarian working for the East India Company. The translation was funded and encouraged by Warren Hastings as a method of increasing colonial hold over the Indies. It was printed privately by the East India Company in London in 1776 under the title A Code of Gentoo Laws, or, Ordinations of the Pundits.  Copies were not put on sale, but the Company did distribute them. In 1777 a pirate (and less luxurious edition) was printed; and in 1781 a second edition appeared. Translations into French and German were published in 1778.

4. Consider the following statements regarding the teachings of Brahmo Samaj
1. It emphasized on the worship and adoration of the Eternal, Unsearchable, Immutable being who is the author and Preserver of the Universe.
2. It opposed Idol worship and denied the teachings of Vedas and Upanishads.
3. Though it discarded the faith in Divine Avataras, it took no definite stand on the doctrine of Karma and transmigration of soul.
Select the correct code
1. 1 and 2
2. 1, 2 and 3
3. 1 and 3
4. Only 3
Answer: 3
Explanation: Statements 1 and 3 were the teachings of Brahmo Samaj. The long term agenda of Brahmo Samaj was to purify Hinduism and to preach monotheism which was based on twin pillars of reason and the Vedas and Upanishads. So statement 2 is wrong.

5. Consider the following statements w.r.t the teachings of Ramakrishna Mission and Arya Samaj-
1. Both opposed Image Worship
2. Both believed in Oneness of GOD
3. They supported proselytization as evident from Shuddhi Movement to reconvert to the Hindu Fold
Select the correct code
1. 1 and 3
2. Only 2
3. Only 1
4. 1, 2 and 3
Answer: 2
Explanation:
Ramakrishna Mission founded by Vivekanada was deeply a religious body, but it was not a proselytizing body. Unlike Arya Samaj, the Mission recognises the utility and value of image worship in developing spiritual fervor and worship of the eternal omnipotent God, although it emphasises the essential spirit and not the symbols or rituals.  Both believed in Oneness of GOD. Shuddhi movement was started by Arya Samaj

6. Consider the following statements w.r.t the famous Indigo Revolt that took place in Bengal-
1. The revolt was not supported by Bengali Middle class who sided with British Administration and Planters to suppress the Peasants.
2. The Peasants got support from Indian Press in Calcutta as well as the aid of some Calcutta-trained lawyers.
Select the wrong statement/s
1. Only 1
2. Only 2
3. Both
4. None
Answer: 1
Explanation:
The Bengali middle class supported the peasants whole-heartedly. Harish Chandra Mukhopadhyay thoroughly described the plight of the poor peasants in his newspaper The Hindu Patriot.  The ryots received moral support from the Indian press in Calcutta as well as the aid of some Calcutta-trained lawyers. The indigo rebellion has been portrayed in drama, poetry and popular history in Bengal, thereby drawing the attention of the intelligentsia. Thus it entered the political awareness and had a far reaching consequence in the later movements of Bengal.

7. The famous revolt of 1857 brought various changes in British Administration of India and the immediate change was the enactment of 'Act of Parliament 1858'. Consider the following statements w.r.t 'Act of Parliament 1858'-
1. The Secretary of State for India was given the powers that were previously wielded by the directors of Company and Board of Directors.
2. Thus the ultimate power over Indian Administration remained with Secretary of State. 
Select the correct statement/s
1. Only 1
2. Only 2
3. Both
4. None
Answer: 1
First statement is correct. The secretary of State was a member of the British Cabinet and as such was responsible to Parliament. Thus the ultimate power over India remained with British Parliament not Secretary of State.

8. The slogan 'No taxation without representation' was the after effect of-
1. Indian Councils Act- 1861
2. American Revolution
3. Russian Revolution
4. Indian Councils Act-1892
Select the correct code
1. 1 and 2
2. 2, 3 and 4
3. 2 and 4
4. All
Answer: 3
Explanation:
"No taxation without representation" is a slogan originating during the 1750s and 1760s that summarized a primary grievance of the American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies, which was one of the major causes of the American Revolution.  Believing that India should eventually move towards democratic self-government, the Early Nationalists wanted a larger share in the governing of India.  Early Nationalists demanded the expansion and reform of the Legislative Councils and British Government was forced by their agitation to pass Indian Councils Act-1892 where the numbers of the Imperial Legislative Councils as well as the provincial councils was increased.  But the nationalists were totally dissatisfied with the Act and declared it to be a hoax. In particular, they demanded Indian control over the public purse and raised the slogan that had earlier become the national cry of the American people during their War of Independence: 'No taxation without representation'

11. Consider the following statements with respect to Solar Wind and Earth Wind-
1. The solar wind is very strong compared to the wind on Earth
2. The solar wind is very weak compared to the wind on Earth, though it is much, much faster than Earth wind.
Select the correct code-
1. Only 1
2. Only 2
3. Both
4. None
Answer:  2
Explanation- The solar wind is very weak compared to the wind on Earth, though it is much, much faster. When we measure solar wind speeds, we typically get speeds of 1-2 million miles per hour. They end up being weaker because there is very little of it. Solar wind density is usually about 100 particles per cubic inch. Thus, a typical pressure from the solar wind is measure in nanopascals whereas at the Earth's surface, the atmospheric pressure is 100 kilopascals, and surface winds are about 100 pascals. Since solar wind is measured in nanopascals it is approximately 1000 million times weaker than winds here on Earth.

12. Recently Solar Storms were in news. Consider the statements with respect to Solar Storms-
1. They are very harmful for Humans and other living organisms on Earth.
2. They can affect communication technologies like GPS and radio communications.
3. They can also affect Power Grids and Electrical units.
Select the wrong statement/s
1. 1 and 2
2. Only 1
3. Only 2
4. Only 3
Answer:  1
Explanation- Solar storms are not dangerous to humans on Earth's surface. These storms are awesome to contemplate, but they cannot harm our human bodies as long as we remain on the surface of Earth, where we're protected by Earth's blanket of atmosphere.  Remember, there's every reason to believe that storms on the sun have been happening for billions of years, since the sun and Earth came to be. If that's so, then all life on Earth evolved under their influence.  What is the danger of a solar storm in space? Very high-energy particles, such as those carried by CMEs, can cause radiation poisoning to humans and other mammals. They would be dangerous to unshielded astronauts, say, astronauts travelling to the moon. Large doses could be fatal.  Still, solar storms - and their effects - are no problem for us on Earth's surface. Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere protect our human bodies from the effects of solar flares.  On the other hand solar storms can be dangerous to our technologies. When a coronal mass ejection, or CME, strikes Earth's atmosphere, it causes a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field. The storm on the sun causes a type of storm on the Earth, known as a geomagnetic storm.  They have the potential to affect power grids, and have been known to black out entire cities, even entire regions.

13. Amongst the following that can be put in the category of 'Social insects'?
1. Honeybee
2. Wasp
3. Termites
4. Bumblebees

2. 1, 3 and 4
3. 1, 2, 3 and 4
4. 1, 2 and 4
Answer:  4
Explanation- All are social insects. Bumblebees were recently in news. India is home to 48 of the 250 known species of bumblebees. It was revealed by the book Indian Bumblebees released in April 2015. 

14. Consider the following statements with reference to 'Tornados and Hurricane'
1. Tornados are more destructive than Hurricanes under the same circumstance
2. Both rotate clockwise in Southern Hemisphere and counter-clock wise in northern Hemisphere.
3. While Hurricanes occurs mostly in warm areas Tornados occurs at places where cold and warm fronts converges.
Select the correct code
1. 1 and 2
2. 2 and 3
3. 1 and 3
4. Only 3
Answer:  2
Explanation- First statement is wrong. Although Tornados are more frequent than Hurricanes but cause less damage as compared to Hurricane. The simple reason is the long lasting nature of Hurricane- few days to weeks. While Tornados lasts for minutes to hours.  Rest statements are true.

15. Which of the following can be the easiest way to predict the upcoming Earthquake?
1. Huge release of Methane gas
2. Release of Radon gas
3. Release of carbon dioxide
4. None
Answer:  2
Explanation- Uranium is found in low-levels in all rocks and soil. Radon is a gaseous radioactive decay product of uranium. As the uranium undergoes radioactive decay, radioactive radon is generated andtrapped in the rocks that contain the uranium.  The earthquake theory involving radon suggests that prior to the actual quake, there is some subterranean movement where rocks are crushed, soil is un-compacted and the trapped radon is released producing a pre-quake spike in radon concentration. 
So radon presents the following attributes:
# it is present in all rocks and soil
# if a rock is broken or if soil is disturbed, radon will be released
# it is gaseous and air currents / thermal gradients will carry it up to the earth's surface producing a detectable plume
# it is radioactive, this makes detecting small amounts or small changes in radon concentration relatively routine due to well-developed and very sensitive methods for detecting and accurately measuring radioactivity.
# Radon has a very short radioactive half-life, a bit under 4 days. Being a gas and having a short half-life is very useful in terms of measuring radon emissions. If a radon emission spike occurs, the gas will dissipate quickly and after about 10 halflives (40 days) normal background levels of radioactivity will return
