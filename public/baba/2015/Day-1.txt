Though Government of India Act, 1919 relaxed the central control over the provinces by demarcating and separating the central and provincial subjects, the structure of government continued to be centralised and unitary. The Act, further divided provincial subjects into two parts-transferred and reserved. The transferred subjects were to be administered by the governor with the aid of ministers responsible to the legislative Council. The reserved subjects, on the other hand, were to be administered by the governor and his executive council without being responsible to the legislative Council. This dual scheme of governance was known as 'dyarchy'.  Separate electorate was introduced by the Morley-Minto Reforms or the Indian Councils Act, 1909
