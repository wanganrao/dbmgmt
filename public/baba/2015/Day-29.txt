3. A boy is whirling a stone tied with a string in a horizontal circular path. If the string breaks, the stone
1. will continue to move in the circular path
2. will move along a straight line towards the centre of the circular path
3. will move along a straight line tangential to the circular path
4. will move along a straight line perpendicular to the circular path away from the boy
Answer:  3
Before the thread is released, the stone moves in a circular path with a certain speed and changes direction at every point. The change in direction involves change in velocity or acceleration. The force that causes this acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path is acting towards the centre. This force is called the centripetal (meaning 'centre-seeking') force. In the absence of this force, the stone flies off along a straight line.  This straight line will be a tangent to the circular path (NCERT- Class 9

2. 1,  4 and 5
3. 1, 3, 4 and 5
4. 2, 4 and 5
Answer:  2
NCERT- Class 9 th , Chapter 1
In understanding the effects of temperature on the solubility of gases, it is first important to remember that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy. As temperature increases, kinetic energy increases. The greater kinetic energy results in greater molecular motion of the gas particles. As a result, the gas particles dissolved in the liquid are more likely to escape to the gas phase and the existing gas particles are less likely to be dissolved.  The converse is true as well. The trend is thus as follows: increased temperatures mean lesser solubility and decreased temperatures mean higher solubility.  Le Chatelier's principle allows better conceptualization of these trends. First, note that the process of dissolving gas in liquid is usually exothermic. As such, increasing temperatures result in stress on the product side (because heat is on the product side). In turn, Le Chatelier's principle predicts that the system shifts towards the reactant side in order to alleviate this new stress. Consequently, the equilibrium concentration of the gas particles in gaseous phase increases, resulting in lowered solubility.  Conversely, decreasing temperatures result in stress on the reactant side (because heat is on the product side). In turn, Le Ch√¢telier's principle predicts that the system shifts toward the product side in order to compensate for this new stress. Consequently, the equilibrium concentration of the gas particles in gaseous phase would decrease, resulting in greater solubility.
