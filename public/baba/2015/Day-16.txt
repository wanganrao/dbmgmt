8. Consider the statements regarding salinization which is a one of the major problem, reducing Indian agricultural productivity.
1. In drier regions, capillary action can lead to salt accumulation on the surface of the land which is brought from the deep saline ground water tables.
2. Irrigation can result in salinization of soils.
3. It can occur both naturally as well as artificially. 
Choose the correct statements from the codes given below.
1. 1, 2 only.
2. 1, 3 only.
3. 2, 3only.
4. All the above.
Answer: 4
In drier regions wherever salt accumulation has occurred because of capillary action, the salts are brought from the shallow depth where the saline ground water table exists.  Salination can be caused by natural processes such as mineral weathering or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about though artificial processes such as irrigation.  Salinity from irrigation can occur over time wherever irrigation is used, since almost all water (even natural rainfall) contains some dissolved salts. When the plants use the water, the salts are left behind in the soil and eventually begin to accumulate.

9. The soil salinization occurred due to irrigation is a concern in drier regions and not in humid regions. Consider the following statements
1. In humid regions, there is enough precipitation to leach (wash) the salts below the plant root zone.
2. In drier regions, higher temperature leads to higher evaporation of water resulting into leaving behind of salt on the surface of the soil.
3. Soil salinization occurring due to irrigation can equally impact both humid areas as well as drier areas.

22. Canary birds are used as early warning system in coal mines. What are the reasons for this?
1. They are able to detect the presence of toxic gases like carbon monoxide.
2. Their breathing rate is slow as compared to human that helps them to reach
to the depth of mines
3. They have high metabolism
Select the correct code
1. Only 1
2. 2 and 3
3. 1 and 3
4. All
Answer:  3
Canary birds were recently relieved from being used as an early warning system in coal mines. With the advent of a range of portable electronic toxic gas detectors, the canaries are now set free and relieved from the dangerous job that they had been doing in the coalmines of the Kothagudem region of Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. With the company introducing state-of-theart handheld gas detectors with sensors and alarm systems for deep excavation, the birds are no longer called in to play the role of an early-warning system for carbon monoxide and other toxic gases in the mines.  The reasons for their use was- The rapid breathing rate, small size and high metabolism of the canaries make them die before miners do on inhaling toxic gases. The men can then be quickly evacuated. The canaries used to be carried in cages and miners had to look for distress signs in the birds.

23. Consider the following with respect to Western Ghat and rainfall pattern along it
1. Karnataka receives more rainfall than Kerala and Maharashtra because of steep slopes and continuous Mountains
2. The mountain topography in Karnataka is broader than the narrow topography of the Ghats in Maharashtra and Kerala. 
Select the incorrect statements
1. Only 1
2. Only 2
3. Both
4. None
Answer:  1
There are several reasons for this. First, the mountain topography in Karnataka is broader than the narrow topography of the Ghats in Maharashtra. Due to the greater width of the mountains, the rain bearing winds have to necessarily travel a longer distance and have more time for the drops to coalesce and precipitate as rainfall, resulting in higher rainfall. In contrast, the narrow width of the Ghats in Maharashtra allows the rain-bearing wind to cross over to the leeward side rapidly before precipitation can occur. As for Kerala, the Ghats there are in the form of isolated mountains, where the rain-bearing winds can easily cross over to the leeward side through the gaps in between without precipitation occurring.  Second, the slope of the mountain has a direct bearing on the possibility of precipitation. This is borne out by the Ghats of Karnataka where the mountains are gently sloping, compared to the steep slopes of the Ghats in Maharashtra and Kerala.  The air parcel will retain its energy and speed for a longer time when the slope is gradual. This will provide sufficient vertical motion to cloud droplets to grow by collision-coalescence process and hence form precipitation.  Third, the gentle slope provides a greater area for sunlight absorption and heating leading to greater convection when compared with an abrupt slope i.e.  less Ghat area such as that of the Maharashtra and Kerala Ghats.  Fourth, the continuous mountain range presents a greater barrier to rainbearing winds than a range comprising isolated mountains with gaps in between where the winds can easily pass to the leeward side. Unlike in the case of Kerala, the Ghats in Maharashtra and Karnataka are continuous.
